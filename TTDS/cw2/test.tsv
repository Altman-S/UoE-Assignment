OT	The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which skirts the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
OT	And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;
OT	Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
OT	For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
OT	Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.
OT	Then the man said, "The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
OT	And the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
OT	Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the LORD respected Abel and his offering,
OT	So the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?
OT	And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.
OT	This is the book of the genealogy of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.
OT	And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
OT	After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters.
OT	After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and had sons and daughters.
OT	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
OT	Then the LORD said to Noah, "Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation.
OT	also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep the species alive on the face of all the earth.
OT	Of clean animals, of animals that are unclean, of birds, and of everything that creeps on the earth,
OT	So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.
OT	And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.
OT	Then God spoke to Noah, saying,
OT	"While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, Cold and heat, Winter and summer, And day and night Shall not cease."
OT	But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
OT	and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every beast of the earth.
OT	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
OT	To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
OT	Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
OT	These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations.
OT	Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
OT	So Abram departed as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
OT	And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; there he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD.
OT	Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.
OT	And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar.
OT	But the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the LORD.
OT	and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is by the wilderness.
OT	Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and attacked all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.
OT	And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand." And he gave him a tithe of all.
OT	Now the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the persons, and take the goods for yourself."
OT	So He said to him, "Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
OT	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.
OT	And God said to Abraham: "As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
OT	and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
OT	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, "Shall a child be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
OT	But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year."
OT	Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
OT	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
OT	And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it.
OT	Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
OT	So the LORD said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
OT	And he spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose there should be forty found there?" So He said, "I will not do it for the sake of forty."
OT	But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
OT	And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wife's hand, and the hands of his two daughters, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
OT	It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, "Indeed I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve the lineage of our father."
OT	So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid.
OT	For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
OT	So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.
OT	Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, namely with Isaac."
OT	And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham's sight because of his son.
OT	So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba.
OT	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
OT	Then Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?"
OT	But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." Then he said, "Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
OT	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
OT	"I am a foreigner and a visitor among you. Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
OT	And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
OT	So the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, which were within all the surrounding borders, were deeded
OT	And the servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?"
OT	But Abraham said to him, "Beware that you do not take my son back there.
OT	Now my master made me swear, saying, "You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;
OT	"But before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, "Please let me drink.'
OT	And I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
OT	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her: "Our sister, may you become The mother of thousands of ten thousands; And may your descendants possess The gates of those who hate them."
OT	Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.
OT	But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If all is well, why am I like this?|" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
OT	And the LORD said to her: "Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger."
OT	The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous;
OT	When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
OT	Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me."
OT	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: "Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, And of the dew of heaven from above.
OT	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,
OT	So he said to them, "Is he well?" And they said, "He is well. And look, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep."
OT	So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?"
OT	Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years."
OT	So she said, "Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she will bear a child on my knees, that I also may have children by her."
OT	And Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
OT	Then Leah said, "A troop comes!" So she called his name Gad.
OT	So he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flocks:
OT	Now Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which was in the rods.
OT	And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
OT	And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and indeed it was not favorable toward him as before.
OT	And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing.
OT	That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
OT	This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
OT	So the present went on over before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.
OT	Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
OT	Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." So he urged him, and he took it.
OT	But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die.
OT	So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. He was more honorable than all the household of his father.
OT	But they said, "Should he treat our sister like a harlot?"
OT	Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone."
OT	Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel.
OT	These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau's wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
OT	And these were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,
OT	But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.
OT	Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, "Some wild beast has devoured him.' We shall see what will become of his dreams!"
OT	Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh." And his brothers listened.
OT	Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes.
OT	Then they sent the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father and said, "We have found this. Do you know whether it is your son's tunic or not?"
OT	And Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother."
OT	And it was told Tamar, saying, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
OT	So she took off her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.
OT	Thus he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
OT	And it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast longing eyes on Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me."
OT	And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker.
OT	And they said to him, "We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it." So Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please."
OT	and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.
OT	Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow.
OT	And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, it was a dream.
OT	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:
OT	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one.
OT	And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are seven years of famine.
OT	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years.
OT	You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you."
OT	Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
OT	And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
OT	But he said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land."
OT	Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!"
OT	Then Joseph said to them the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear God:
OT	"The man who is lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
OT	And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me: Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin. All these things are against me."
OT	But if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, "You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you."'
OT	And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!"
OT	Now the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, "It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may make a case against us and seize us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys."
OT	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack.
OT	Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.
OT	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, "My brothers and those of my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
OT	And they said to Pharaoh, "We have come to dwell in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
OT	Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land may not be desolate."
OT	So they said, "You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
OT	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaoh's.
OT	but let me lie with my fathers; you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." And he said, "I will do as you have said."
OT	And Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days:
OT	"Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between two burdens;
OT	And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.
OT	And Joseph said to his brethren, "I am dying; but God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
OT	Then Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."
OT	All those who were descendants of Jacob were seventy persons (for Joseph was in Egypt already).
OT	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty.
OT	And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
OT	Then the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
OT	And they said, "An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock."
OT	Then Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn."
OT	So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and after that he will let you go.
OT	But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, namely, of her who dwells near her house, articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians."
OT	But he said, "O my Lord, please send by the hand of whomever else You may send."
OT	And Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are many now, and you make them rest from their labor!"
OT	And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before. You shall not reduce it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, "Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
OT	Go, get yourselves straw where you can find it; yet none of your work will be reduced."'
OT	So the LORD said to Moses: "See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.
OT	But Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I may lay My hand on Egypt and bring My armies and My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
OT	So the LORD said to Moses: "Pharaoh's heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go.
OT	And the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, "Thus says the LORD: "Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
OT	And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
OT	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained.
OT	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and tell him, "Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: "Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
OT	for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart, and on your servants and on your people, that you may know that there is none like Me in all the earth.
OT	As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go.
OT	Entreat the LORD, that there may be no more mighty thundering and hail, for it is enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
OT	Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud.
OT	So Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: "How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
OT	And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field.
OT	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land--all that the hail has left."
OT	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. They were very severe; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them.
OT	And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
OT	Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
OT	And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning.
OT	And you shall observe this thing as an ordinance for you and your sons forever.
OT	And it shall be, when your children say to you, "What do you mean by this service?'
OT	So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
OT	And the Egyptians urged the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste. For they said, "We shall all be dead."
OT	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
OT	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years--on that very same day--it came to pass that all the armies of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
OT	On this day you are going out, in the month Abib.
OT	It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.
OT	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with boldness.
OT	And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.
OT	Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
OT	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
OT	The enemy said, "I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, My hand shall destroy them.'
OT	And they journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt.
OT	And so it was, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
OT	Then Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: "Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt."'
OT	And so it was, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
OT	And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
OT	Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and other sacrifices to offer to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
OT	And so it was, on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening.
OT	Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you: Stand before God for the people, so that you may bring the difficulties to God.
OT	Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own land.
OT	Then the LORD said to him, "Away! Get down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest He break out against them."
OT	"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
OT	"You shall not steal.
OT	"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's."
OT	"And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
OT	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
OT	"If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for the sake of his eye.
OT	"If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.
OT	If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies, is hurt, or driven away, no one seeing it,
OT	"And if a man borrows anything from his neighbor, and it becomes injured or dies, the owner of it not being with it, he shall surely make it good.
OT	If you ever take your neighbor's garment as a pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down.
OT	"You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe produce and your juices. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me.
OT	Likewise you shall do with your oxen and your sheep. It shall be with its mother seven days; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me.
OT	"You shall not pervert the judgment of your poor in his dispute.
OT	You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; none shall appear before Me empty);
OT	But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
OT	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you tablets of stone, and the law and commandments which I have written, that you may teach them."
OT	You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the Testimony that I will give you.
OT	And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that are at its four legs.
OT	Five curtains shall be coupled to one another, and the other five curtains shall be coupled to one another.
OT	Fifty loops you shall make in the one curtain, and fifty loops you shall make on the edge of the curtain that is on the end of the second set, that the loops may be clasped to one another.
OT	And you shall make fifty bronze clasps, put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.
OT	"And for the tabernacle you shall make the boards of acacia wood, standing upright.
OT	For the far side of the tabernacle, westward, you shall make six boards.
OT	Also you shall make its pans to receive its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze.
OT	You shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, that the network may be midway up the altar.
OT	"And along the width of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits, with their ten pillars and their ten sockets.
OT	"Now take Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister to Me as priest, Aaron and Aaron's sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
OT	And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.
OT	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They shall be set in gold settings.
OT	They shall bind the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod, using a blue cord, so that it is above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and so that the breastplate does not come loose from the ephod.
OT	"You shall also make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet: HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
OT	"And this is what you shall do to them to hallow them for ministering to Me as priests: Take one young bull and two rams without blemish,
OT	"And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and you shall wash them with water.
OT	"You shall also have the bull brought before the tabernacle of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bull.
OT	One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight.
OT	"You shall make an altar to burn incense on; you shall make it of acacia wood.
OT	Two gold rings you shall make for it, under the molding on both its sides. You shall place them on its two sides, and they will be holders for the poles with which to bear it.
OT	The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when you give an offering to the LORD, to make atonement for yourselves.
OT	And you shall take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for yourselves."
OT	And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
OT	And the LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and indeed it is a stiff-necked people!
OT	But he said: "It is not the noise of the shout of victory, Nor the noise of the cry of defeat, But the sound of singing I hear."
OT	So it was, as soon as he came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. So Moses' anger became hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
OT	Then he took the calf which they had made, burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder; and he scattered it on the water and made the children of Israel drink it.
OT	Now when Moses saw that the people were unrestrained (for Aaron had not restrained them, to their shame among their enemies),
OT	Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of meeting. And it came to pass that everyone who sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of meeting which was outside the camp.
OT	And He said, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
OT	Then he said to Him, "If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.
OT	Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen."
OT	So Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.
OT	"And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year's end.
OT	blue, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats' hair;
OT	oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense;

OT	and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, in knowledge and all manner of workmanship,

OT	"And He has put in his heart the ability to teach, in him and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
OT	Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing,
OT	for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done--indeed too much.
OT	He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the curtain on the selvedge of one set; likewise he did on the outer edge of the other curtain of the second set.
OT	And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from one end to the other.
OT	And he cast for it four rings of gold to be set in its four corners: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side of it.
OT	And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold all around it.
OT	The rings were close to the frame, as holders for the poles to bear the table.
OT	And on the lampstand itself were four bowls made like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and flower.
OT	He made the incense altar of acacia wood. Its length was a cubit and its width a cubit--it was square--and two cubits was its height. Its horns were of one piece with it.
OT	He made all the utensils for the altar: the pans, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the firepans; all its utensils he made of bronze.
OT	The screen for the gate of the court was woven of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine woven linen. The length was twenty cubits, and the height along its width was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
OT	All the gold that was used in all the work of the holy place, that is, the gold of the offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
OT	They made shoulder straps for it to couple it together; it was coupled together at its two edges.
OT	the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
OT	They made two other gold rings and put them on the two shoulder straps, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod.
OT	and a sash of fine woven linen with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, made by a weaver, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
OT	And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
OT	the ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the mercy seat;
OT	the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, the screen for the court gate, its cords, and its pegs; all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
OT	You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and put up the screen for the door of the tabernacle.
OT	Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did.
OT	He took the Testimony and put it into the ark, inserted the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark.
OT	He hung up the screen at the door of the tabernacle.
OT	"If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD.
OT	"If his offering is of the flocks--of the sheep or of the goats--as a burnt sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish.
OT	and the priest shall burn them on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
OT	Then he shall offer from it his offering, as an offering made by fire to the LORD. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
OT	"This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you shall eat neither fat nor blood."'
OT	if the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then let him offer to the LORD for his sin which he has sinned a young bull without blemish as a sin offering.
OT	And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of meeting; and he shall pour the remaining blood of the bull at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.
OT	as it was taken from the bull of the sacrifice of the peace offering; and the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt offering.
OT	or if his sin which he has committed comes to his knowledge, he shall bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a male without blemish.
OT	"If a person sins and commits a trespass against the LORD by lying to his neighbor about what was delivered to him for safekeeping, or about a pledge, or about a robbery, or if he has extorted from his neighbor,
OT	"This is the law of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it on the altar before the LORD.
OT	The priest from among his sons, who is anointed in his place, shall offer it. It is a statute forever to the LORD. It shall be wholly burned.
OT	Everyone who touches its flesh must be holy. And when its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled, in a holy place.
OT	All the males among the priests may eat it. It is most holy.
OT	In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the trespass offering. And its blood he shall sprinkle all around on the altar.
OT	the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;
OT	Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other.
OT	But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, while he is unclean, that person shall be cut off from his people.
OT	Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people."'
OT	Then he put the breastplate on him, and he put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate.
OT	And he put the turban on his head. Also on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
OT	Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
OT	Then he took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
OT	What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
OT	Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tabernacle of meeting day and night for seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you may not die; for so I have been commanded."
OT	And he said to Aaron, "Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
OT	And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, "Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering,
OT	Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar.
OT	Their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. They are unclean to you.
OT	And whatever goes on its paws, among all kinds of animals that go on all fours, those are unclean to you. Whoever touches any such carcass shall be unclean until evening.
OT	"And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth shall be an abomination. It shall not be eaten.
OT	You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps; nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, lest you be defiled by them.
OT	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
OT	"When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes on the skin of his body like a leprous sore, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
OT	then the priest shall examine it; and indeed if the hair of the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy broken out in the burn. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore.
OT	then the priest shall look; and indeed if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is a white spot that grows on the skin. He is clean.
OT	And he shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, in the leather or in anything made of leather, the plague is an active leprosy. It is unclean.
OT	As for the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.
OT	And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering.
OT	And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside, all around, and the dust that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.
OT	And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
OT	"But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
OT	"Then Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of meeting, shall take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them there.
OT	For on that day the priest shall make atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
OT	then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tabernacle of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
OT	This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel, for all their sins, once a year." And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.
OT	and does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of meeting to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, the guilt of bloodshed shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people,
OT	"Also you shall say to them: "Whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
OT	For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.'
OT	According to the doings of the land of Egypt, where you dwelt, you shall not do; and according to the doings of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you, you shall not do; nor shall you walk in their ordinances.
OT	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is near of kin to your father.
OT	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother. You shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
OT	For the land is defiled; therefore I visit the punishment of its iniquity upon it, and the land vomits out its inhabitants.
OT	"You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.
OT	And if the people of the land should in any way hide their eyes from the man, when he gives some of his descendants to Molech, and they do not kill him,
OT	Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am the LORD your God.
OT	But I have said to you, "You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey." I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
OT	nor shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.
OT	the person who has touched any such thing shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat the holy offerings unless he washes his body with water.
OT	"Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work on it; it is the Sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
OT	And you shall offer on that day, when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering to the LORD.
OT	You shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor fresh grain until the same day that you have brought an offering to your God; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
OT	"And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall be completed.
OT	The priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
OT	You shall do no manner of work; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
OT	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
OT	You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths,
OT	And whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him, the stranger as well as him who is born in the land. When he blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall be put to death.
OT	And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family.
OT	"And if you say, "What shall we eat in the seventh year, since we shall not sow nor gather in our produce?"
OT	And in all the land of your possession you shall grant redemption of the land.
OT	"If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year he may redeem it.
OT	However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be counted as the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
OT	after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brothers may redeem him;
OT	or his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him; or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him; or if he is able he may redeem himself.
OT	I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none will make you afraid; I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword will not go through your land.
OT	Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you.
OT	"Then, if you walk contrary to Me, and are not willing to obey Me, I will bring on you seven times more plagues, according to your sins.
OT	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham I will remember; I will remember the land.
OT	But for their sake I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD."'
OT	He shall not substitute it or exchange it, good for bad or bad for good; and if he at all exchanges animal for animal, then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy.
OT	If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.
OT	but the field, when it is released in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a devoted field; it shall be the possession of the priest.
OT	And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.

OT	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering;
OT	and as the sacrifice of peace offerings: two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Elizur the son of Shedeur.

OT	And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
OT	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon."
OT	Now the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road.
OT	And the Angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because your way is perverse before Me.
OT	The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live."
OT	Then the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
OT	So Balaam answered and said to Balak, "Did I not tell you, saying, "All that the LORD speaks, that I must do'?"
OT	"How lovely are your tents, O Jacob! Your dwellings, O Israel!
OT	Now therefore, flee to your place. I said I would greatly honor you, but in fact, the LORD has kept you back from honor."
OT	"I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; A Star shall come out of Jacob; A Scepter shall rise out of Israel, And batter the brow of Moab, And destroy all the sons of tumult.
OT	Now Israel remained in Acacia Grove, and the people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab.
OT	They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
OT	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
OT	and it shall be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel."'
OT	And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a father's house in Midian.
OT	And the son of Pallu was Eliab.
OT	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign.
OT	of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites; of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites.
OT	All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those who were numbered of them, were sixty-four thousand four hundred.
OT	The sons of Naphtali according to their families were: of Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the family of the Gunites;
OT	And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered profane fire before the LORD.
OT	Then came the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
OT	And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it."' And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, just as the LORD commanded Moses.
OT	And you shall give some of your authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
OT	So Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
OT	Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
OT	It is a regular burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
OT	You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a regular burnt offering.
OT	Their grain offering shall be fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
OT	Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
OT	and one-tenth for each of the fourteen lambs;
OT	and their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, by their number, according to the ordinance;
OT	If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
OT	But if her husband overrules her on the day that he hears it, he shall make void her vow which she took and what she uttered with her lips, by which she bound herself, and the LORD will release her.
OT	Every vow and every binding oath to afflict her soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void.
OT	They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their forts.
OT	Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
OT	Purify every garment, everything made of leather, everything woven of goats' hair, and everything made of wood."
OT	The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the LORD's tribute was seventy-two.
OT	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all the fashioned ornaments.
OT	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
OT	For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people."
OT	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: "Your servants will do as my lord commands.
OT	They moved from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
OT	Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.
OT	They departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
OT	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
OT	"Command the children of Israel, and say to them: "When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance--the land of Canaan to its boundaries.
OT	And you shall take one leader of every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance.
OT	"And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
OT	Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.
OT	And you answered me and said, "The thing which you have told us to do is good.'
OT	And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
OT	"So we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as the LORD our God had commanded us. Then we came to Kadesh Barnea.
OT	And I said to you, "You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
OT	And they departed and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
OT	But as for you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.'
OT	You must not fear them, for the LORD your God Himself fights for you.'
OT	"Then I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying:
OT	"For what great nation is there that has God so near to it, as the LORD our God is to us, for whatever reason we may call upon Him?
OT	Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I would not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
OT	Out of heaven He let you hear His voice, that He might instruct you; on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire.
OT	The LORD talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire.
OT	I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up the mountain. He said:
OT	"Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may be well with you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you.
OT	"You shall not steal.
OT	"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.'
OT	You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
OT	then beware, lest you forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
OT	"When the LORD your God brings you into the land which you go to possess, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you,
OT	You shall not be terrified of them; for the LORD your God, the great and awesome God, is among you.
OT	"Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.
OT	"So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
OT	Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
OT	Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, just as the LORD commanded me."
OT	Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no longer.
OT	You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him, and to Him you shall hold fast, and take oaths in His name.
OT	Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the terebinth trees of Moreh?
OT	"However, you may slaughter and eat meat within all your gates, whatever your heart desires, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and the deer alike.
OT	Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
OT	You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments and obey His voice; you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him.
OT	you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it, all that is in it and its livestock--with the edge of the sword.
OT	And you may eat every animal with cloven hooves, having the hoof split into two parts, and that chews the cud, among the animals.
OT	Also the swine is unclean for you, because it has cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud; you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcasses.
OT	the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe and the bat.
OT	"Also every creeping thing that flies is unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.
OT	And this is the form of the release: Every creditor who has lent anything to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not require it of his neighbor or his brother, because it is called the LORD's release.
OT	"If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother,
OT	Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, "The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,' and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to the LORD against you, and it become sin among you.
OT	You shall surely give to him, and your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand.
OT	Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water.
OT	And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the LORD your God chooses, and in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents.
OT	The hands of the witnesses shall be the first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall put away the evil from among you.
OT	And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge there in those days, and inquire of them; they shall pronounce upon you the sentence of judgment.
OT	then both men in the controversy shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who serve in those days.
OT	And the judges shall make careful inquiry, and indeed, if the witness is a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother,
OT	So it shall be, when you are on the verge of battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people.
OT	for the LORD your God is He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.'
OT	And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
OT	and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and desire her and would take her for your wife,
OT	"You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fall down along the road, and hide yourself from them; you shall surely help him lift them up again.
OT	"If a bird's nest happens to be before you along the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, with the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young;
OT	you shall surely let the mother go, and take the young for yourself, that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days.
OT	"But if the thing is true, and evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman,
OT	then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he humbled his neighbor's wife; so you shall put away the evil from among you.
OT	and you shall have an implement among your equipment, and when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and turn and cover your refuse.
OT	He may dwell with you in your midst, in the place which he chooses within one of your gates, where it seems best to him; you shall not oppress him.
OT	"Take heed in an outbreak of leprosy, that you carefully observe and do according to all that the priests, the Levites, shall teach you; just as I commanded them, so you shall be careful to do.
OT	Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the way when you came out of Egypt!
OT	And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I command you to do this thing.
OT	He has brought us to this place and has given us this land, "a land flowing with milk and honey";
OT	then you shall say before the LORD your God: "I have removed the holy tithe from my house, and also have given them to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all Your commandments which You have commanded me; I have not transgressed Your commandments, nor have I forgotten them.
OT	Also today the LORD has proclaimed you to be His special people, just as He promised you, that you should keep all His commandments,
OT	Therefore it shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, that on Mount Ebal you shall set up these stones, which I command you today, and you shall whitewash them with lime.
OT	"Cursed is the one who lies with any kind of animal.'"And all the people shall say, "Amen!'
OT	"Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the LORD your God will set you high above all nations of the earth.
OT	And the LORD will grant you plenty of goods, in the fruit of your body, in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your ground, in the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.
OT	And your heavens which are over your head shall be bronze, and the earth which is under you shall be iron.
OT	Locusts shall consume all your trees and the produce of your land.
OT	The sensitive and very refined man among you will be hostile toward his brother, toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the rest of his children whom he leaves behind,
OT	"If you do not carefully observe all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, THE LORD YOUR GOD,
OT	And it shall be, that just as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good and multiply you, so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to nothing; and you shall be plucked from off the land which you go to possess.
OT	Your life shall hang in doubt before you; you shall fear day and night, and have no assurance of life.
OT	and so it may not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, "I shall have peace, even though I follow the dictates of my heart'--as though the drunkard could be included with the sober.
OT	Then people would say: "Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt;
OT	"Also the LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
OT	And you will again obey the voice of the LORD and do all His commandments which I command you today.
OT	It is not in heaven, that you should say, "Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'
OT	Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.
OT	And Moses commanded them, saying: "At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Tabernacles,
OT	when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
OT	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, the days approach when you must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that I may inaugurate him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting.
OT	When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant.
OT	Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As raindrops on the tender herb, And as showers on the grass.
OT	"They have corrupted themselves; They are not His children, Because of their blemish: A perverse and crooked generation.
OT	For the LORD's portion is His people; Jacob is the place of His inheritance.
OT	They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
OT	For a fire is kindled in My anger, And shall burn to the lowest hell; It shall consume the earth with her increase, And set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
OT	"Is this not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up among My treasures?
OT	For it is not a futile thing for you, because it is your life, and by this word you shall prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess."
OT	Yet you shall see the land before you, though you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel."
OT	With the precious things of the earth and its fullness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let the blessing come "on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.'
OT	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
OT	So the men answered her, "Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."
OT	and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest),
OT	and command them, saying, "Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight."'
OT	that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, "What do these stones mean to you?'
OT	And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.
OT	then you shall let your children know, saying, "Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land';
OT	for the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,
OT	So Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
OT	So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed.
OT	Then the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
OT	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets.
OT	In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to families; and the family which the LORD takes shall come by households; and the household which the LORD takes shall come man by man.
OT	And Achan answered Joshua and said, "Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I have done:
OT	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it."
OT	Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Achor.
OT	For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will say, "They are fleeing before us as at the first.' Therefore we will flee before them.
OT	Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua.
OT	So they said to him: "From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt,
OT	This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now look, it is dry and moldy.
OT	Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim.
OT	But the children of Israel did not attack them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the rulers.
OT	Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, "We are very far from you,' when you dwell near us?
OT	Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being slaves--woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."
OT	So they answered Joshua and said, "Because your servants were clearly told that the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
OT	And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, in the place which He would choose, even to this day.
OT	"Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
OT	Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.
OT	And they struck all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was none left breathing. Then he burned Hazor with fire.
OT	And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the children of Israel took as booty for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left none breathing.
OT	As the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
OT	For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
OT	One king was Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled half of Gilead, from Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, from the middle of that river, even as far as the River Jabbok, which is the border of the Ammonites,
OT	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
OT	the king of Tirzah, one--all the kings, thirty-one.
OT	And Moses had given to the tribe of the children of Reuben an inheritance according to their families.
OT	Jahaza, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
OT	Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, which is before Rabbah,
OT	and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir,
OT	and in the valley Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as its border, as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth, on the other side of the Jordan eastward.
OT	So Moses swore on that day, saying, "Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children's forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.'
OT	And their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
OT	The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.
OT	Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir (formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher).
OT	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty-nine, with their villages.
OT	Jiphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
OT	Ekron, with its towns and villages;
OT	Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor,
OT	As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
OT	and went down westward to the boundary of the Japhletites, as far as the boundary of Lower Beth Horon to Gezer; and it ended at the sea.
OT	And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day and have become forced laborers.
OT	And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies east of Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.
OT	Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them.
OT	Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the Wilderness of Beth Aven.
OT	The third lot came out for the children of Zebulun according to their families, and the border of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.
OT	Then from Sarid it went eastward toward the sunrise along the border of Chisloth Tabor, and went out toward Daberath, bypassing Japhia.
OT	Alammelech, Amad, and Mishal; it reached to Mount Carmel westward, along the Brook Shihor Libnath.
OT	Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh: nineteen cities with their villages.
OT	So they appointed Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountains of Naphtali, Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and Kirjath Arba (which is Hebron) in the mountains of Judah.
OT	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwelt among them, that whoever killed a person accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation.
OT	But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
OT	Thus to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its common-land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Libnah with its common-land,
OT	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their common-lands.
OT	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, the rest of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim.
OT	Helkath with its common-land, and Rehob with its common-land: four cities;
OT	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their common-lands.
OT	Every one of these cities had its common-land surrounding it; thus were all these cities.
OT	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,
OT	See, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea westward.
OT	know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations from before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
OT	"Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed.
OT	Then Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek.
OT	Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
OT	And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
OT	However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.
OT	Therefore I also said, "I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you."'
OT	When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the LORD nor the work which He had done for Israel.
OT	Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for calamity, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.
OT	Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, went and defeated Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms.
OT	After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel.
OT	Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Arose a mother in Israel.
OT	Far from the noise of the archers, among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, The righteous acts for His villagers in Israel; Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates.
OT	that the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: "I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage;
OT	So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them.
OT	So Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it The-LORD-Is-Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
OT	So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the LORD had said to him. But because he feared his father's household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night.
OT	Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, "Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from Mount Gilead."' And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
OT	And he said to them, "Look at me and do likewise; watch, and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do:
OT	When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp, and say, "The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!"'
OT	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
OT	Now the men of Ephraim said to him, "Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?" And they reprimanded him sharply.
OT	Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked the army while the camp felt secure.
OT	So Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength." So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
OT	Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them: "Listen to me, you men of Shechem, That God may listen to you!
OT	So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.
OT	And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
OT	Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.
OT	Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more.
OT	Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah.
OT	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah.
OT	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"
OT	And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
OT	then they would say to him, "Then say, "Shibboleth'!" And he would say, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites.
OT	Now there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children.
OT	For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
OT	So the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A Man of God came to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name.
OT	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, "Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You."
OT	And the Angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?"
OT	Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
OT	Then Samson said to them, "Let me pose a riddle to you. If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.
OT	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us?" And he said to them, "As they did to me, so I have done to them."
OT	Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the LORD and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
OT	So God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
OT	Then Delilah said to Samson, "Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me what you may be bound with."
OT	When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said: "Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, The destroyer of our land, And the one who multiplied our dead."
OT	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
OT	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he was a Levite, and was staying there.
OT	And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" So he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to stay."
OT	So they set up for themselves Micah's carved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
OT	So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman's father said to the man, "Please be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry."
OT	They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, "Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it."
OT	But the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not commit this outrage.
OT	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the children of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this wicked deed happen?"
OT	We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to make provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel."
OT	Now therefore, deliver up the men, the perverted men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel!" But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel.
OT	Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways. Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom, and killed two thousand of them.
OT	So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children.
OT	The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion--Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.
OT	And she said, "Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law."
OT	When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.
OT	I went out full, and the LORD has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
OT	And Boaz answered and said to her, "It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before.
OT	And she said to her, "All that you say to me I will do."
OT	Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day."
OT	And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
OT	Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him.
OT	Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon;
OT	So Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!"
OT	Therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD." So they worshiped the LORD there.
OT	So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.
OT	Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: "Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
OT	And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you did call me." Then Eli perceived that the LORD had called the boy.
OT	Now the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel answered, "Speak, for Your servant hears."
OT	Then the Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.
OT	Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
OT	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, "What does the sound of this tumult mean?" And the man came quickly and told Eli.
OT	And she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
OT	Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.
OT	Then take the ark of the LORD and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go.
OT	The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the LORD.
OT	So when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
OT	and the golden rats, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and country villages, even as far as the large stone of Abel on which they set the ark of the LORD, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
OT	And the men of Beth Shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? And to whom shall it go up from us?"
OT	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up with you."
OT	So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
OT	He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
OT	But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your father's house?"
OT	And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, "Set it apart."'
OT	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
OT	And Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?" So all the people shouted and said, "Long live the king!"
OT	Then Samuel said to the people, "Do not fear. You have done all this wickedness; yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
OT	Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will work for us. For nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few."
OT	So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven.
OT	And Saul said, "Come over here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today.
OT	The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
OT	Thus says the LORD of hosts: "I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt.
OT	So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, "Saul went to Carmel, and indeed, he set up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal."
OT	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."
OT	Let our master now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. And it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the distressing spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well."
OT	David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, "I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them." So David took them off.
OT	And the Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!"
OT	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.
OT	So the king said, "Inquire whose son this young man is."
OT	So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
OT	So Saul eyed David from that day forward.
OT	And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul's hand.
OT	and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David's enemy continually.
OT	So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."
OT	So Jonathan said to him, "By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!"
OT	Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. Nevertheless, if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?"
OT	But if I say thus to the young man, "Look, the arrows are beyond you'--go your way, for the LORD has sent you away.
OT	And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, indeed the LORD be between you and me forever."
OT	And it happened the next day, the second day of the month, that David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat, either yesterday or today?"
OT	So Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem.
OT	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die."
OT	Then Saul cast a spear at him to kill him, by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David.
OT	And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about four hundred men with him.
OT	So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob. And they all came to the king.
OT	Then David inquired of the LORD once again. And the LORD answered him and said, "Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand."
OT	When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David. Therefore he went down to the rock, and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon.
OT	Now it happened, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, "Take note! David is in the Wilderness of En Gedi."
OT	Then Nabal answered David's servants, and said, "Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master.
OT	Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him."
OT	And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand.
OT	So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and respected your person."
OT	Then it happened, after about ten days, that the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
OT	And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, by the road. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
OT	And David said in his heart, "Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me anymore in any part of Israel. So I shall escape out of his hand."
OT	And David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. For those nations were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as you go to Shur, even as far as the land of Egypt.
OT	Now Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" And Saul answered, "I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, neither by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may reveal to me what I should do."
OT	Then Samuel said: "So why do you ask me, seeing the LORD has departed from you and has become your enemy?
OT	So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.
OT	Then David said to him, "To whom do you belong, and where are you from?" And he said, "I am a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick.
OT	Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, "This is David's spoil."
OT	But David said, "My brethren, you shall not do so with what the LORD has given us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us.
OT	So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
OT	those who were in Hormah, those who were in Chorashan, those who were in Athach,
OT	So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
OT	Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
OT	So David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
OT	"O mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Nor fields of offerings. For the shield of the mighty is cast away there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
OT	Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
OT	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.
OT	Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Are you Asahel?" He answered, "I am."
OT	So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore.
OT	and the sixth, Ithream, by David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
OT	Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening his hold on the house of Saul.
OT	And the king sang a lament over Abner and said: "Should Abner die as a fool dies?
OT	And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. The LORD shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness."
OT	Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin,
OT	when someone told me, saying, "Look, Saul is dead,' thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag--the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news.
OT	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, "You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you," thinking, "David cannot come in here."
OT	Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house.
OT	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
OT	And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the Name, the LORD of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim.
OT	And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
OT	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
OT	Then King David went in and sat before the LORD; and he said: "Who am I, O Lord GOD? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
OT	And who is like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a name--and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land--before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods?
OT	For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, LORD, have become their God.
OT	So let Your name be magnified forever, saying, "The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel.' And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.
OT	Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You, O Lord GOD, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever."
OT	After this it came to pass that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them. And David took Metheg Ammah from the hand of the Philistines.
OT	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer,
OT	So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered judgment and justice to all his people.
OT	Now David said, "Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
OT	Then he bowed himself, and said, "What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I?"
OT	When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered together.
OT	And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity."
OT	David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.
OT	So the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
OT	So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate.
OT	After this Absalom the son of David had a lovely sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
OT	But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother. Now Jonadab was a very crafty man.
OT	So Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, "Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand."'
OT	Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
OT	And David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Now go to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."
OT	Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom.
OT	Now when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."
OT	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Arise, be gone!"
OT	Then Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her robe of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away crying bitterly.
OT	And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he was dead.
OT	Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. So it was, whenever anyone who had a lawsuit came to the king for a decision, that Absalom would call to him and say, "What city are you from?" And he would say, "Your servant is from such and such a tribe of Israel."
OT	Then all his servants passed before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, passed before the king.
OT	So David said to Ittai, "Go, and cross over." Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over.
OT	So Hushai, David's friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem.
OT	And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
OT	The LORD has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you are caught in your own evil, because you are a bloodthirsty man!"
OT	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give advice as to what we should do."
OT	So Hushai said to Absalom: "The advice that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.
OT	For," said Hushai, "you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are enraged in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not camp with the people.
OT	Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised.
OT	And David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
OT	Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom.
OT	The king said, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was about."
OT	Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: "O my son Absalom--my son, my son Absalom--if only I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!"
OT	Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.
OT	You are my brethren, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?'
OT	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?"
OT	So it was, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
OT	And there happened to be there a rebel, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a trumpet, and said: "We have no share in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!"
OT	And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after Sheba.
OT	Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down.
OT	Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the sons of the giant.
OT	The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
OT	From the brightness before Him Coals of fire were kindled.
OT	With the pure You will show Yourself pure; And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd.
OT	God is my strength and power, And He makes my way perfect.
OT	You enlarged my path under me; So my feet did not slip.
OT	For You have armed me with strength for the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose against me.
OT	You have also given me the necks of my enemies, So that I destroyed those who hated me.
OT	"The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was on my tongue.
OT	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the captains. He was called Adino the Eznite, because he had killed eight hundred men at one time.
OT	He arose and attacked the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.
OT	And he said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this! Is this not the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.
OT	Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
OT	Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
OT	Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words."
OT	For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, "Long live King Adonijah!'
OT	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and paid homage to the king, and said, "Let my lord King David live forever!"
OT	As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."
OT	While he was still speaking, there came Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest. And Adonijah said to him, "Come in, for you are a prominent man, and bring good news."
OT	Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, "No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
OT	So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way.
OT	The king said moreover to Shimei, "You know, as your heart acknowledges, all the wickedness that you did to my father David; therefore the LORD will return your wickedness on your own head.
OT	And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places.
OT	The speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
OT	Then God said to him: "Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,
OT	So the king answered and said, "Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she is his mother."
OT	And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month of the year.
OT	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth Shean, which is beside Zaretan below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as the other side of Jokneam;
OT	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
OT	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, each man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
OT	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, because he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always loved David.
OT	Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:
OT	So the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together.
OT	Now the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, its length was sixty cubits, its width twenty, and its height thirty cubits.
OT	Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:
OT	So Solomon built the temple and finished it.
OT	The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with ornamental buds and open flowers. All was cedar; there was no stone to be seen.
OT	And the other cherub was ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same size and shape.
OT	There were windows with beveled frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
OT	And he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
OT	Below its brim were ornamental buds encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The ornamental buds were cast in two rows when it was cast.
OT	It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts pointed inward.
OT	Then Solomon spoke: "The LORD said He would dwell in the dark cloud.
OT	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
OT	Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O LORD my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today:
OT	"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin because You afflict them,
OT	"When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and they take them captive to the land of the enemy, far or near;
OT	and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who led them away captive, and pray to You toward their land which You gave to their fathers, the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name:
OT	For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, as You spoke by Your servant Moses, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD."
OT	And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he wanted to do,
OT	And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, "Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'
OT	Now it happened at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house
OT	all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
OT	Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon.
OT	And they went to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.
OT	The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
OT	And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
OT	Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
OT	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
OT	Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land.
OT	And this is what caused him to rebel against the king: Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the damages to the City of David his father.
OT	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, "How do you advise me to answer these people?"
OT	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and dwelt there. Also he went out from there and built Penuel.
OT	Then he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it,
OT	Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back;
OT	And he spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled it.
OT	After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
OT	And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another person? For I have been sent to you with bad news.
OT	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
OT	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.
OT	And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
OT	Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
OT	surely I will take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
OT	And also the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed them.
OT	And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned the king's house down upon himself with fire, and died,
OT	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
OT	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
OT	Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him.
OT	So she said to Elijah, "What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son?"
OT	So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.
OT	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Israel shall be your name."
OT	Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that You are the LORD God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again."
OT	Then the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
OT	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he prayed that he might die, and said, "It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!"
OT	And the angel of the LORD came back the second time, and touched him, and said, "Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you."
OT	Then He said, "Go out, and stand on the mountain before the LORD." And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake;
OT	And he said, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life."
OT	Then the LORD said to him: "Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, anoint Hazael as king over Syria.
OT	And the king of Israel answered and said, "My lord, O king, just as you say, I and all that I have are yours."
OT	Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, "Tell my lord the king, "All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do."' And the messengers departed and brought back word to him.
OT	And he found another man, and said, "Strike me, please." So the man struck him, inflicting a wound.
OT	While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone." Then the king of Israel said to him, "So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it."
OT	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, "Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?"
OT	So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
OT	So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
OT	And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
OT	and say, "Thus says the king: "Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.'
OT	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
OT	Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
OT	for he served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.
OT	Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was injured; so he sent messengers and said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury."
OT	Again, he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and said to him: "Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.
OT	And it came to pass, when the LORD was about to take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
OT	So he said, "You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so."
OT	Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
OT	Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, "Thus says the LORD: "I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness."'
OT	Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, "Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"
OT	And the king of Israel said, "Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
OT	And he said, "Thus says the LORD: "Make this valley full of ditches.'
OT	And this is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
OT	And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones."
OT	And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there.
OT	Then she called to her husband, and said, "Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back."
OT	Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, "The child has not awakened."
OT	But he said, "As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing." And he urged him to take it, but he refused.
OT	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, "Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him."
OT	Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.
OT	Now Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." But he led them to Samaria.
OT	Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Arise and go, you and your household, and stay wherever you can; for the LORD has called for a famine, and furthermore, it will come upon the land for seven years."
OT	It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land.
OT	But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.
OT	And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, "Get yourself ready, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.
OT	So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
OT	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those who reared Ahab's sons, saying:
OT	Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master's sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons,
OT	So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
OT	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
OT	In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds--of the bodyguards and the escorts--and brought them into the house of the LORD to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.
OT	So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses' entrance into the king's house, and there she was killed.
OT	Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king's house. Then he sat on the throne of the kings.
OT	Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; then Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
OT	For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
OT	And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
OT	He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel to this day.
OT	And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, "Give your daughter to my son as wife'; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
OT	And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent.
OT	Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
OT	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.
OT	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
OT	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.
OT	and had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
OT	And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them from His sight.
OT	But the LORD your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."
OT	However they did not obey, but they followed their former rituals.
OT	The LORD was with him; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
OT	And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
OT	So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house.
OT	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
OT	And when they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.
OT	Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"'
OT	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned home, and remained at Nineveh.
OT	Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,
OT	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD:
OT	"And they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you, whom you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."'
OT	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a wooden image, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
OT	He even set a carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;
OT	But they paid no attention, and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
OT	because they have done evil in My sight, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day."'
OT	But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
OT	And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of the LORD; let them give it to those who are in the house of the LORD doing the work, to repair the damages of the house--
OT	Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the officer who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
OT	As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
OT	Then the king commanded all the people, saying, "Keep the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant."
OT	Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.
OT	In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went to the aid of the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him. And Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo when he confronted him.
OT	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
OT	By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.

OT	And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, "Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!" So God granted him what he requested.
OT	And Eshton begot Beth-Rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Ir-Nahash. These were the men of Rechah.
OT	also Jokim, the men of Chozeba, and Joash; Saraph, who ruled in Moab, and Jashubi-Lehem. Now the records are ancient.

OT	Now these are the sons of Aaron: Eleazar his son, Phinehas his son, Abishua his son,
OT	Bukki his son, Uzzi his son, Zerahiah his son,
OT	Zadok his son, and Ahimaaz his son.
OT	Now some of the families of the sons of Kohath were given cities as their territory from the tribe of Ephraim.
OT	And they gave them one of the cities of refuge, Shechem with its common-lands, in the mountains of Ephraim, also Gezer with its common-lands,
OT	And from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Aner with its common-lands and Bileam with its common-lands, for the rest of the family of the sons of Kohath.

OT	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed by him at one time.
OT	And he said, "Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.

OT	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren, the sons of Merari, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
OT	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with strings according to Alamoth;
OT	Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to direct with harps on the Sheminith;
OT	Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark;
OT	And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the City of David, that Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing music; and she despised him in her heart.
OT	So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
OT	O seed of Israel His servant, You children of Jacob, His chosen ones!
OT	Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan As the allotment of your inheritance,"
OT	For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray before You.
OT	When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab went to Jerusalem.
OT	Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
OT	Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves, but Ornan continued threshing wheat.
OT	But Ornan said to David, "Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Look, I also give you the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give it all."
OT	For the tabernacle of the LORD and the altar of the burnt offering, which Moses had made in the wilderness, were at that time at the high place in Gibeon.
OT	Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
OT	Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters, and all types of skillful men for every kind of work.
OT	Of these, twenty-four thousand were to look after the work of the house of the LORD, six thousand were officers and judges,
OT	both with the showbread and the fine flour for the grain offering, with the unleavened cakes and what is baked in the pan, with what is mixed and with all kinds of measures and sizes;
OT	There were more leaders found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus they were divided. Among the sons of Eleazar were sixteen heads of their fathers' houses, and eight heads of their fathers' houses among the sons of Ithamar.
OT	Thus they were divided by lot, one group as another, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of the house of God, from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar.
OT	the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
OT	the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
OT	Of the sons of Uzziel, Michah; of the sons of Michah, Shamir.
OT	the tenth for Shimei, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
OT	All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons and their brethren, able men with strength for the work: sixty-two of Obed-Edom.
OT	On the east were six Levites, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, and for the storehouse two by two.
OT	These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Korah and among the sons of Merari.
OT	The sons of Laadan, the descendants of the Gershonites of Laadan, heads of their fathers' houses, of Laadan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
OT	The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and Joel his brother, were over the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
OT	Of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
OT	The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
OT	The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
OT	over the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; over the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah;
OT	and Jaziz the Hagrite was over the flocks. All these were the officials over King David's property.
OT	the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the LORD?"
OT	"Now therefore, our God, We thank You And praise Your glorious name.
OT	And give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision."
OT	So they ate and drank before the LORD with great gladness on that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before the LORD to be the leader, and Zadok to be priest.
OT	All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, submitted themselves to King Solomon.
OT	Now the acts of King David, first and last, indeed they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
OT	And Solomon said to God: "You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
OT	Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?"
OT	Then God said to Solomon: "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life--but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king--
OT	Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants will be with your servants,
OT	And indeed I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
OT	Now Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
OT	And the vestibule that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
OT	Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.
OT	Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God:
OT	Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy Place, under the wings of the cherubim.
OT	And it came to pass when the priests came out of the Most Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without keeping to their divisions),
OT	then hear from heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, bringing retribution on the wicked by bringing his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.
OT	"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin because You afflict them,
OT	"O LORD God, do not turn away the face of Your Anointed; Remember the mercies of Your servant David."
OT	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
OT	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
OT	At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
OT	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, "You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel.'
OT	All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel--
OT	They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.
OT	Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
OT	Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, much more than she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
OT	And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.
OT	All King Solomon's drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
OT	For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.
OT	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
OT	Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
OT	And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.
OT	And they spoke to him, saying, "If you are kind to these people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever."
OT	And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!"'
OT	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
OT	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities.
OT	And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, to be leader among his brothers; for he intended to make him king.
OT	Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel along with him.
OT	But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
OT	So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years.
OT	Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God,
OT	And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians were overthrown, and they could not recover, for they were broken before the LORD and His army. And they carried away very much spoil.
OT	He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.
OT	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
OT	Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
OT	Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.
OT	And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken.
OT	Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.
OT	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, "Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand."
OT	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore the wrath of the LORD is upon you.
OT	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.
OT	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much.
OT	And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.
OT	and you will become very sick with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.
OT	Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.
OT	Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, "because," they said, "he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom.
OT	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people in the temple of the LORD.
OT	Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD.
OT	Now concerning his sons, and the many oracles about him, and the repairing of the house of God, indeed they are written in the annals of the book of the kings. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
OT	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
OT	Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king.
OT	Therefore the anger of the LORD was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, "Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?"
OT	Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall--you and Judah with you?"
OT	So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
OT	Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
OT	He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.
OT	Now he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.
OT	The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.
OT	Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings to cast stones.
OT	So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is a leper." Then Jotham his son reigned in his place.
OT	He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. And the people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The people of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also.
OT	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
OT	He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
OT	And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?
OT	Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,
OT	Also Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not assist him.
OT	So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
OT	Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square,
OT	So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
OT	Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
OT	Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.
OT	And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
OT	So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing to the LORD, accompanied by loud instruments.
OT	For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
OT	Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
OT	And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God they laid in heaps.
OT	In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.
OT	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
OT	and to all who were written in the genealogy--their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them--for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.
OT	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before the LORD his God.
OT	Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?
OT	Then they called out with a loud voice in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and trouble them, that they might take the city.
OT	Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven.
OT	So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
OT	and prayed to Him; and He received his entreaty, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.
OT	Also his prayer and how God received his entreaty, and all his sin and trespass, and the sites where he built high places and set up wooden images and carved images, before he was humbled, indeed they are written among the sayings of Hozai.
OT	So Shaphan carried the book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, "All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
OT	Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
OT	The king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem--the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD.
OT	Thus Josiah removed all the abominations from all the country that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel diligently serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not depart from following the LORD God of their fathers.
OT	Then Josiah gave the lay people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover offerings for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand cattle; these were from the king's possessions.
OT	And his leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred from the flock, and three hundred cattle.
OT	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.
OT	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem.
OT	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
OT	the people of Pahath-Moab, of the people of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and twelve;
OT	the people of Zattu, nine hundred and forty-five;
OT	the people of Azgad, one thousand two hundred and twenty-two;
OT	the people of Gibbar, ninety-five;
OT	the people of Kirjath Arim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three;
OT	the men of Bethel and Ai, two hundred and twenty-three;
OT	the sons of Asnah, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephusim,
OT	the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur,
OT	And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.
OT	Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those countries, they set the altar on its bases; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening burnt offerings.
OT	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
OT	In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
OT	The letter which you sent to us has been clearly read before me.
OT	Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased, and it was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
OT	this Ezra came up from Babylon; and he was a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given. The king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
OT	Some of the children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
OT	of the sons of Shelomith, Ben-Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males;
OT	and weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes, and all Israel who were present, had offered.
OT	So when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard, and sat down astonished.
OT	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel assembled to me, because of the transgression of those who had been carried away captive, and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.
OT	And I said: "O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens.
OT	For we were slaves. Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to repair the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
OT	By the first day of the first month they finished questioning all the men who had taken pagan wives.
OT	of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth;
OT	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;
OT	Then I said to them, "You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach."
OT	So I answered them, and said to them, "The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem."
OT	And next to them Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, made repairs. Next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs. Next to them Zadok the son of Baana made repairs.
OT	And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor of the region beyond the River.
OT	Malchijah the son of Harim and Hashub the son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section, as well as the Tower of the Ovens.
OT	And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the leader of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the Ascent to the Armory at the buttress.
OT	And between the upper room at the corner, as far as the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.
OT	So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
OT	And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
OT	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.
OT	For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
OT	These are the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city.
OT	Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:
OT	the sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two;
OT	the sons of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty;
OT	the men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight;
OT	the men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred and twenty-one;
OT	The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three;
OT	The singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight.
OT	besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five men and women singers.
OT	Then he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
OT	For they have not served You in their kingdom, Or in the many good things that You gave them, Or in the large and rich land which You set before them; Nor did they turn from their wicked works.
OT	"Here we are, servants today! And the land that You gave to our fathers, To eat its fruit and its bounty, Here we are, servants in it!
OT	And it yields much increase to the kings You have set over us, Because of our sins; Also they have dominion over our bodies and our cattle At their pleasure; And we are in great distress.
OT	"And because of all this, We make a sure covenant and write it; Our leaders, our Levites, and our priests seal it."
OT	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
OT	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
OT	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
OT	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
OT	Now the rest of the people--the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone who had knowledge and understanding--
OT	Also in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin. The children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;
OT	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four.
OT	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
OT	Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.
OT	of Abijah, Zichri; the son of Minjamin; of Moadiah, Piltai;
OT	those closest to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king's presence, and who ranked highest in the kingdom):
OT	This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king's officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath.
OT	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women's quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given them.
OT	Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months' preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women.
OT	Thus prepared, each young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women's quarters to the king's palace.
OT	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
OT	Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was.
OT	So they told Mordecai Esther's words.
OT	For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
OT	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said."
OT	And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!"
OT	So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?"
OT	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, "Indeed, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews.
OT	Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
OT	The remainder of the Jews in the king's provinces gathered together and protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.
OT	But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
OT	the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year, according to the written instructions and according to the prescribed time,
OT	And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
OT	Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
OT	But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!"
OT	In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.
OT	And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.
OT	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place--Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him.
OT	"May the day perish on which I was born, And the night in which it was said, "A male child is conceived.'
OT	There the wicked cease from troubling, And there the weary are at rest.
OT	Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?
OT	For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me.
OT	But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; It touches you, and you are troubled.
OT	The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
OT	"Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
OT	If He puts no trust in His servants, If He charges His angels with error,
OT	How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before a moth?
OT	You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
OT	The caravans of Tema look, The travelers of Sheba hope for them.
OT	He shall never return to his house, Nor shall his place know him anymore.
OT	So that my soul chooses strangling And death rather than my body.
OT	"What is man, that You should exalt him, That You should set Your heart on him,
OT	So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish,
OT	He does great things past finding out, Yes, wonders without number.
OT	He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with bitterness.
OT	"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.
OT	Then I would speak and not fear Him, But it is not so with me.
OT	I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.
OT	He leads princes away plundered, And overthrows the mighty.
OT	They grope in the dark without light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
OT	Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then You respond to me.
OT	Why do You hide Your face, And regard me as Your enemy?
OT	You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall desire the work of Your hands.
OT	But his flesh will be in pain over it, And his soul will mourn over it."
OT	He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine, And cast off his blossom like an olive tree.
OT	God has delivered me to the ungodly, And turned me over to the hands of the wicked.
OT	For You have hidden their heart from understanding; Therefore You will not exalt them.
OT	Yet the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger.
OT	My days are past, My purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.
OT	It devours patches of his skin; The firstborn of death devours his limbs.
OT	If indeed you exalt yourselves against me, And plead my disgrace against me,
OT	He has stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.
OT	His troops come together And build up their road against me; They encamp all around my tent.
OT	Be afraid of the sword for yourselves; For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, That you may know there is a judgment."
OT	"Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer, Because of the turmoil within me.
OT	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment?
OT	Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, And his head reaches to the clouds,
OT	He will fly away like a dream, and not be found; Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
OT	He will not see the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and cream.
OT	It is drawn, and comes out of the body; Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors come upon him;
OT	Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, Never having eaten with pleasure.
OT	"Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you, And enters into judgment with you?
OT	For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason, And stripped the naked of their clothing.
OT	Who were cut down before their time, Whose foundations were swept away by a flood?
OT	Receive, please, instruction from His mouth, And lay up His words in your heart.
OT	Then you will lay your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.
OT	For then you will have your delight in the Almighty, And lift up your face to God.
OT	Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!
OT	Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness, And He did not hide deep darkness from my face.
OT	"Since times are not hidden from the Almighty, Why do those who know Him see not His days?
OT	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox as a pledge.
OT	They press out oil within their walls, And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
OT	For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death; If someone recognizes them, They are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
OT	If even the moon does not shine, And the stars are not pure in His sight,
OT	How much less man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, who is a worm?"
OT	"The dead tremble, Those under the waters and those inhabiting them.
OT	He covers the face of His throne, And spreads His cloud over it.
OT	"May my enemy be like the wicked, And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.
OT	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, Though he may gain much, If God takes away his life?
OT	It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed for its price.
OT	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban.
OT	I broke the fangs of the wicked, And plucked the victim from his teeth.
OT	"Then I said, "I shall die in my nest, And multiply my days as the sand.
OT	"Men listened to me and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.
OT	They are gaunt from want and famine, Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste,
OT	But You have become cruel to me; With the strength of Your hand You oppose me.
OT	"I have made a covenant with my eyes; Why then should I look upon a young woman?
OT	"If I have walked with falsehood, Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,
OT	For that would be a fire that consumes to destruction, And would root out all my increase.
OT	"If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me,
OT	Then let my arm fall from my shoulder, Let my arm be torn from the socket.
OT	For destruction from God is a terror to me, And because of His magnificence I cannot endure.
OT	This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment, For I would have denied God who is above.
OT	(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his soul);
OT	If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or caused its owners to lose their lives;
OT	So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you.
OT	I said, "Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.'
OT	Lest you say, "We have found wisdom'; God will vanquish him, not man.
OT	Now he has not directed his words against me; So I will not answer him with your words.
OT	For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away.
OT	"But please, Job, hear my speech, And listen to all my words.
OT	"If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness,
OT	He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness.
OT	Then he looks at men and says, "I have sinned, and perverted what was right, And it did not profit me.'
OT	If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you.
OT	Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
OT	"If you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words:
OT	He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place.
OT	Should He repay it according to your terms, Just because you disavow it? You must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what you know.
OT	Moreover Elihu answered and said:
OT	He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity.
OT	But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.
OT	Which the clouds drop down And pour abundantly on man.
OT	He covers His hands with lightning, And commands it to strike.
OT	For He says to the snow, "Fall on the earth'; Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength.
OT	The beasts go into dens, And remain in their lairs.
OT	"Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.
OT	"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding.
OT	When I fixed My limit for it, And set bars and doors;
OT	Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?
OT	Their young ones are healthy, They grow strong with grain; They depart and do not return to them.
OT	Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes? Or will he plow the valleys behind you?
OT	She treats her young harshly, as though they were not hers; Her labor is in vain, without concern,
OT	Does the eagle mount up at your command, And make its nest on high?
OT	His bones are like beams of bronze, His ribs like bars of iron.
OT	He is the first of the ways of God; Only He who made him can bring near His sword.
OT	He lies under the lotus trees, In a covert of reeds and marsh.
OT	Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him? Everything under heaven is Mine.
OT	One is so near another That no air can come between them;
OT	So Job died, old and full of days.
OT	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the ungodly shall perish.
OT	He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The LORD shall hold them in derision.
OT	I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustained me.
OT	For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil dwell with You.
OT	Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
OT	For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks?
OT	You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet,
OT	All sheep and oxen--Even the beasts of the field,
OT	I will praise You, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous works.
OT	O enemy, destructions are finished forever! And you have destroyed cities; Even their memory has perished.
OT	That I may tell of all Your praise In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will rejoice in Your salvation.
OT	Why do the wicked renounce God? He has said in his heart, "You will not require an account."
OT	Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man; Seek out his wickedness until You find none.
OT	For the LORD is righteous, He loves righteousness; His countenance beholds the upright.
OT	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
OT	There they are in great fear, For God is with the generation of the righteous.
OT	LORD, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill?
OT	In whose eyes a vile person is despised, But he honors those who fear the LORD; He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
OT	I will bless the LORD who has given me counsel; My heart also instructs me in the night seasons.
OT	Let my vindication come from Your presence; Let Your eyes look on the things that are upright.
OT	And He rode upon a cherub, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind.
OT	He makes my feet like the feet of deer, And sets me on my high places.
OT	Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the Gentiles, And sing praises to Your name.
OT	Moreover by them Your servant is warned, And in keeping them there is great reward.
OT	They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stand upright.
OT	You have given him his heart's desire, And have not withheld the request of his lips.Selah
OT	For the king trusts in the LORD, And through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
OT	"He trusted in the LORD, let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!"
OT	But You are He who took Me out of the womb; You made Me trust while on My mother's breasts.
OT	The earth is the LORD's, and all its fullness, The world and those who dwell therein.
OT	Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory.Selah
OT	Remember, O LORD, Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses, For they are from of old.
OT	For Your name's sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
OT	Teach me Your way, O LORD, And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.
OT	To You I will cry, O LORD my Rock: Do not be silent to me, Lest, if You are silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.
OT	And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a wide place.
OT	Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous; And shout for joy, all you upright in heart!
OT	Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous! For praise from the upright is beautiful.
OT	For the word of the LORD is right, And all His work is done in truth.
OT	The LORD looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men.
OT	For our heart shall rejoice in Him, Because we have trusted in His holy name.
OT	Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.
OT	Depart from evil and do good; Seek peace and pursue it.
OT	Also draw out the spear, And stop those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
OT	But in my adversity they rejoiced And gathered together; Attackers gathered against me, And I did not know it; They tore at me and did not cease;
OT	The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
OT	I have been young, and now am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his descendants begging bread.
OT	For the LORD loves justice, And does not forsake His saints; They are preserved forever, But the descendants of the wicked shall be cut off.
OT	The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, And his tongue talks of justice.
OT	There is no soundness in my flesh Because of Your anger, Nor any health in my bones Because of my sin.
OT	Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
OT	Remove Your plague from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.
OT	Then I said, "Behold, I come; In the scroll of the book it is written of me.
OT	I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth From the great assembly.
OT	For innumerable evils have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; Therefore my heart fails me.
OT	My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say to me, "Where is your God?"
OT	Oh, send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your tabernacle.
OT	You make us turn back from the enemy, And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.
OT	If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or stretched out our hands to a foreign god,
OT	The royal daughter is all glorious within the palace; Her clothing is woven with gold.
OT	She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors; The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to You.
OT	God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.
OT	God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, just at the break of dawn.
OT	The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.
OT	Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!
OT	God reigns over the nations; God sits on His holy throne.
OT	Beautiful in elevation, The joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north, The city of the great King.
OT	Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
OT	Why should I fear in the days of evil, When the iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
OT	For he sees wise men die; Likewise the fool and the senseless person perish, And leave their wealth to others.
OT	Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever, Their dwelling places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.
OT	Though while he lives he blesses himself (For men will praise you when you do well for yourself),
OT	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God will shine forth.
OT	Let the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is Judge.Selah
OT	"Now consider this, you who forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, And there be none to deliver:
OT	Whoever offers praise glorifies Me; And to him who orders his conduct aright I will show the salvation of God."
OT	Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions.
OT	Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.
OT	Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners shall be converted to You.
OT	Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.
OT	The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none who does good.
OT	So I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
OT	Indeed, I would wander far off, And remain in the wilderness.Selah
OT	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues, For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
OT	Day and night they go around it on its walls; Iniquity and trouble are also in the midst of it.
OT	In God (I will praise His word), In the LORD (I will praise His word),
OT	For You have delivered my soul from death. Have You not kept my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?
OT	Do you indeed speak righteousness, you silent ones? Do you judge uprightly, you sons of men?
OT	Let them flow away as waters which run continually; When he bends his bow, Let his arrows be as if cut in pieces.
OT	You therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors.Selah
OT	At evening they return, They growl like a dog, And go all around the city.
OT	You have shown Your people hard things; You have made us drink the wine of confusion.
OT	He shall abide before God forever. Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him!
OT	They only consult to cast him down from his high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But they curse inwardly.Selah
OT	Also to You, O Lord, belongs mercy; For You render to each one according to his work.
OT	Because You have been my help, Therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice.
OT	The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and trust in Him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.
OT	They drop on the pastures of the wilderness, And the little hills rejoice on every side.
OT	Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You.
OT	Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You shall judge the people righteously, And govern the nations on earth.Selah
OT	When the Almighty scattered kings in it, It was white as snow in Zalmon.
OT	Blessed be the Lord, Who daily loads us with benefits, The God of our salvation!Selah
OT	Our God is the God of salvation; And to GOD the Lord belong escapes from death.
OT	They have seen Your procession, O God, The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
OT	Envoys will come out of Egypt; Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.
OT	Let their table become a snare before them, And their well-being a trap.
OT	The humble shall see this and be glad; And you who seek God, your hearts shall live.
OT	O God, You have taught me from my youth; And to this day I declare Your wondrous works.
OT	He will bring justice to the poor of the people; He will save the children of the needy, And will break in pieces the oppressor.
OT	And He shall live; And the gold of Sheba will be given to Him; Prayer also will be made for Him continually, And daily He shall be praised.
OT	They set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth.
OT	O God, how long will the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?
OT	You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up mighty rivers.
OT	Oh, do not let the oppressed return ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise Your name.
OT	When God arose to judgment, To deliver all the oppressed of the earth.Selah
OT	Has His mercy ceased forever? Has His promise failed forevermore?
OT	For He established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;
OT	And forgot His works And His wonders that He had shown them.
OT	In spite of this they still sinned, And did not believe in His wondrous works.
OT	Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouth, And they lied to Him with their tongue;
OT	He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust.
OT	He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore trees with frost.
OT	Their priests fell by the sword, And their widows made no lamentation.
OT	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.
OT	The dead bodies of Your servants They have given as food for the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
OT	Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem, And there was no one to bury them.
OT	You have made us a strife to our neighbors, And our enemies laugh among themselves.
OT	Sing aloud to God our strength; Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob.
OT	How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked?Selah
OT	For they have consulted together with one consent; They form a confederacy against You:
OT	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites;
OT	Who said, "Let us take for ourselves The pastures of God for a possession."
OT	Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; They will still be praising You.Selah
OT	O God, behold our shield, And look upon the face of Your anointed.
OT	For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD will give grace and glory; No good thing will He withhold From those who walk uprightly.
OT	Bow down Your ear, O LORD, hear me; For I am poor and needy.
OT	Preserve my life, for I am holy; You are my God; Save Your servant who trusts in You!
OT	Rejoice the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
OT	Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And attend to the voice of my supplications.
OT	Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.
OT	And of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one were born in her; And the Most High Himself shall establish her."
OT	You have put away my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut up, and I cannot get out;
OT	You rule the raging of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them.
OT	I have found My servant David; With My holy oil I have anointed him,
OT	With whom My hand shall be established; Also My arm shall strengthen him.
OT	Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David:
OT	In the morning it flourishes and grows up; In the evening it is cut down and withers.
OT	You have set our iniquities before You, Our secret sins in the light of Your countenance.
OT	So teach us to number our days, That we may gain a heart of wisdom.
OT	Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence.
OT	A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it shall not come near you.
OT	Because you have made the LORD, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
OT	But You, LORD, are on high forevermore.
OT	Rise up, O Judge of the earth; Render punishment to the proud.
OT	The sea is His, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land.
OT	Give to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Give to the LORD glory and strength.
OT	Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice before the LORD.
OT	Zion hears and is glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments, O LORD.
OT	Oh, sing to the LORD a new song! For He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have gained Him the victory.
OT	I will sing of mercy and justice; To You, O LORD, I will sing praises.
OT	My enemies reproach me all day long; Those who deride me swear an oath against me.
OT	My days are like a shadow that lengthens, And I wither away like grass.
OT	The children of Your servants will continue, And their descendants will be established before You."
OT	Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases,
OT	He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel.
OT	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor punished us according to our iniquities.
OT	For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.
OT	At Your rebuke they fled; At the voice of Your thunder they hastened away.
OT	And wine that makes glad the heart of man, Oil to make his face shine, And bread which strengthens man's heart.
OT	He appointed the moon for seasons; The sun knows its going down.
OT	O LORD, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all. The earth is full of Your possessions--
OT	When they went from one nation to another, From one kingdom to another people,
OT	He sent Moses His servant, And Aaron whom He had chosen.
OT	For He remembered His holy promise, And Abraham His servant.
OT	Praise the LORD! Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever.
OT	When they envied Moses in the camp, And Aaron the saint of the LORD,
OT	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, And covered the faction of Abiram.
OT	They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor, And ate sacrifices made to the dead.
OT	But they mingled with the Gentiles And learned their works;
OT	Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
OT	Because they rebelled against the words of God, And despised the counsel of the Most High,
OT	Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.
OT	Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
OT	They see the works of the LORD, And His wonders in the deep.
OT	For He commands and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up the waves of the sea.
OT	Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, And praise Him in the company of the elders.
OT	Whoever is wise will observe these things, And they will understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
OT	That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and hear me.
OT	Give us help from trouble, For the help of man is useless.
OT	Thus they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
OT	Let his days be few, And let another take his office.
OT	But You, O GOD the Lord, Deal with me for Your name's sake; Because Your mercy is good, deliver me.
OT	I also have become a reproach to them; When they look at me, they shake their heads.
OT	Let them curse, but You bless; When they arise, let them be ashamed, But let Your servant rejoice.
OT	I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; Yes, I will praise Him among the multitude.
OT	He has given food to those who fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.
OT	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do His commandments. His praise endures forever.
OT	O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs?
OT	But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases.
OT	Those who make them are like them; So is everyone who trusts in them.
OT	Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go through them, And I will praise the LORD.
OT	The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.
OT	Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD! We have blessed you from the house of the LORD.
OT	You are my God, and I will praise You; You are my God, I will exalt You.
OT	Your word I have hidden in my heart, That I might not sin against You.
OT	You rebuke the proud--the cursed, Who stray from Your commandments.
OT	And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, For I have hoped in Your ordinances.
OT	I remembered Your judgments of old, O LORD, And have comforted myself.
OT	You are my portion, O LORD; I have said that I would keep Your words.
OT	Their heart is as fat as grease, But I delight in Your law.
OT	The proud have dug pits for me, Which is not according to Your law.
OT	I am afflicted very much; Revive me, O LORD, according to Your word.
OT	Deal with Your servant according to Your mercy, And teach me Your statutes.
OT	Therefore all Your precepts concerning all things I consider to be right; I hate every false way.
OT	Trouble and anguish have overtaken me, Yet Your commandments are my delights.
OT	My eyes are awake through the night watches, That I may meditate on Your word.
OT	Many are my persecutors and my enemies, Yet I do not turn from Your testimonies.
OT	I rejoice at Your word As one who finds great treasure.
OT	Great peace have those who love Your law, And nothing causes them to stumble.
OT	I am for peace; But when I speak, they are for war.
OT	My help comes from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
OT	Behold, He who keeps Israel Shall neither slumber nor sleep.
OT	The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul.
OT	Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
OT	When the LORD brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream.
OT	Bring back our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South.
OT	Behold, thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the LORD.
OT	The LORD is righteous; He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked.
OT	If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
OT	For Your servant David's sake, Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed.
OT	For the LORD will judge His people, And He will have compassion on His servants.
OT	To Him who alone does great wonders, For His mercy endures forever;
OT	To Him who made great lights, For His mercy endures forever--
OT	The sun to rule by day, For His mercy endures forever;
OT	We hung our harps Upon the willows in the midst of it.
OT	Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light are both alike to You.
OT	Oh, that You would slay the wicked, O God! Depart from me, therefore, you bloodthirsty men.
OT	For they speak against You wickedly; Your enemies take Your name in vain.
OT	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me.
OT	Look on my right hand and see, For there is no one who acknowledges me; Refuge has failed me; No one cares for my soul.
OT	I cried out to You, O LORD: I said, "You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
OT	Teach me to do Your will, For You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.
OT	Revive me, O LORD, for Your name's sake! For Your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
OT	Man is like a breath; His days are like a passing shadow.
OT	I will meditate on the glorious splendor of Your majesty, And on Your wondrous works.
OT	Men shall speak of the might of Your awesome acts, And I will declare Your greatness.
OT	Do not put your trust in princes, Nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help.
OT	Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite.
OT	The LORD lifts up the humble; He casts the wicked down to the ground.
OT	He gives to the beast its food, And to the young ravens that cry.
OT	He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
OT	Let them praise the name of the LORD, For He commanded and they were created.
OT	Praise the LORD from the earth, You great sea creatures and all the depths;
OT	Fire and hail, snow and clouds; Stormy wind, fulfilling His word;
OT	Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,
OT	To understand a proverb and an enigma, The words of the wise and their riddles.
OT	For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.
OT	So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners.
OT	Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares.
OT	"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge.
OT	Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded,
OT	Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke,
OT	Whose ways are crooked, And who are devious in their paths;
OT	For her house leads down to death, And her paths to the dead;
OT	In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.
OT	The wise shall inherit glory, But shame shall be the legacy of fools.
OT	Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you honor, when you embrace her.
OT	Her feet go down to death, Her steps lay hold of hell.
OT	Lest aliens be filled with your wealth, And your labors go to the house of a foreigner;
OT	Provides her supplies in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest.
OT	A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil,
OT	So I came out to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, And I have found you.
OT	For my husband is not at home; He has gone on a long journey;
OT	Till an arrow struck his liver. As a bird hastens to the snare, He did not know it would cost his life.
OT	Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, And from the opening of my lips will come right things;
OT	They are all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.
OT	When He prepared the heavens, I was there, When He drew a circle on the face of the deep,
OT	When He assigned to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth,
OT	She has slaughtered her meat, She has mixed her wine, She has also furnished her table.
OT	Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
OT	Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
OT	If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you will bear it alone."
OT	To call to those who pass by, Who go straight on their way:
OT	The wise in heart will receive commands, But a prating fool will fall.
OT	The mouth of the righteous is a well of life, But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
OT	Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all sins.
OT	Whoever hides hatred has lying lips, And whoever spreads slander is a fool.
OT	The hope of the righteous will be gladness, But the expectation of the wicked will perish.
OT	The integrity of the upright will guide them, But the perversity of the unfaithful will destroy them.
OT	When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish, And the hope of the unjust perishes.
OT	Though they join forces, the wicked will not go unpunished; But the posterity of the righteous will be delivered.
OT	He who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will flourish like foliage.
OT	A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth, And the recompense of a man's hands will be rendered to him.
OT	There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise promotes health.
OT	A wise son heeds his father's instruction, But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
OT	A righteous man hates lying, But a wicked man is loathsome and comes to shame.
OT	Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless, But wickedness overthrows the sinner.
OT	The ransom of a man's life is his riches, But the poor does not hear rebuke.
OT	Hope deferred makes the heart sick, But when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.
OT	Every prudent man acts with knowledge, But a fool lays open his folly.
OT	He who walks with wise men will be wise, But the companion of fools will be destroyed.
OT	A faithful witness does not lie, But a false witness will utter lies.
OT	The heart knows its own bitterness, And a stranger does not share its joy.
OT	Even in laughter the heart may sorrow, And the end of mirth may be grief.
OT	He who is slow to wrath has great understanding, But he who is impulsive exalts folly.
OT	A sound heart is life to the body, But envy is rottenness to the bones.
OT	The king's favor is toward a wise servant, But his wrath is against him who causes shame.
OT	The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Keeping watch on the evil and the good.
OT	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, But the prayer of the upright is His delight.
OT	A scoffer does not love one who corrects him, Nor will he go to the wise.
OT	In mercy and truth Atonement is provided for iniquity; And by the fear of the LORD one departs from evil.
OT	Righteous lips are the delight of kings, And they love him who speaks what is right.
OT	He winks his eye to devise perverse things; He purses his lips and brings about evil.
OT	The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, But the LORD tests the hearts.
OT	A man devoid of understanding shakes hands in a pledge, And becomes surety for his friend.
OT	He who has a deceitful heart finds no good, And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil.
OT	A merry heart does good, like medicine, But a broken spirit dries the bones.
OT	Wisdom is in the sight of him who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
OT	Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit.
OT	The foolishness of a man twists his way, And his heart frets against the LORD.
OT	A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who speaks lies will not escape.
OT	Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD.
OT	There are many plans in a man's heart, Nevertheless the LORD's counsel--that will stand.
OT	The fear of the LORD leads to life, And he who has it will abide in satisfaction; He will not be visited with evil.
OT	The lazy man will not plow because of winter; He will beg during harvest and have nothing.
OT	Diverse weights and diverse measures, They are both alike, an abomination to the LORD.
OT	Blows that hurt cleanse away evil, As do stripes the inner depths of the heart.
OT	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; How much more when he brings it with wicked intent!
OT	Hear, my son, and be wise; And guide your heart in the way.
OT	Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
OT	These things also belong to the wise: It is not good to show partiality in judgment.
OT	Do not say, "I will do to him just as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work."
OT	As the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable.
OT	Take away the dross from silver, And it will go to the silversmith for jewelry.
OT	Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of the great;
OT	Debate your case with your neighbor, And do not disclose the secret to another;
OT	A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold In settings of silver.
OT	As cold water to a weary soul, So is good news from a far country.
OT	Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
OT	As iron sharpens iron, So a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
OT	He who gives to the poor will not lack, But he who hides his eyes will have many curses.
OT	When the wicked arise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
OT	Scoffers set a city aflame, But wise men turn away wrath.
OT	Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; But happy is he who keeps the law.
OT	I neither learned wisdom Nor have knowledge of the Holy One.
OT	There is a generation that curses its father, And does not bless its mother.
OT	A hateful woman when she is married, And a maidservant who succeeds her mistress.
OT	There are three things which are majestic in pace, Yes, four which are stately in walk:
OT	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Nor for princes intoxicating drink;
OT	Lest they drink and forget the law, And pervert the justice of all the afflicted.
OT	Open your mouth for the speechless, In the cause of all who are appointed to die.
OT	Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies.
OT	She also rises while it is yet night, And provides food for her household, And a portion for her maidservants.
OT	She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hand holds the spindle.
OT	There is no remembrance of former things, Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come By those who will come after.
OT	I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards.
OT	I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me.
OT	I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, and musical instruments of all kinds.
OT	The wise man's eyes are in his head, But the fool walks in darkness. Yet I myself perceived That the same event happens to them all.
OT	Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
OT	I said in my heart, "Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals."
OT	When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed--
OT	But those riches perish through misfortune; When he begets a son, there is nothing in his hand.
OT	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:
OT	Since there are many things that increase vanity, How is man the better?
OT	No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit, And no one has power in the day of death. There is no release from that war, And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.
OT	So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.
OT	A wise man's heart is at his right hand, But a fool's heart at his left.
OT	Even when a fool walks along the way, He lacks wisdom, And he shows everyone that he is a fool.
OT	Because of laziness the building decays, And through idleness of hands the house leaks.
OT	Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, And let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth; Walk in the ways of your heart, And in the sight of your eyes; But know that for all these God will bring you into judgment.
OT	The Preacher sought to find acceptable words; and what was written was upright--words of truth.
OT	For God will bring every work into judgment, Including every secret thing, Whether good or evil.
OT	Do not look upon me, because I am dark, Because the sun has tanned me. My mother's sons were angry with me; They made me the keeper of the vineyards, But my own vineyard I have not kept.
OT	His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me.
OT	The fig tree puts forth her green figs, And the vines with the tender grapes Give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away!
OT	Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, With me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards.
OT	The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls Took my veil away from me.
OT	My beloved is white and ruddy, Chief among ten thousand.
OT	Like a piece of pomegranate Are your temples behind your veil.
OT	My dove, my perfect one, Is the only one, The only one of her mother, The favorite of the one who bore her. The daughters saw her And called her blessed, The queens and the concubines, And they praised her.
OT	Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see if the vine has budded, Whether the grape blossoms are open, And the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
OT	If she is a wall, We will build upon her A battlement of silver; And if she is a door, We will enclose her With boards of cedar.
OT	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
OT	The ox knows its owner And the donkey its master's crib; But Israel does not know, My people do not consider."
OT	He shall judge between the nations, And rebuke many people; They shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war anymore.
OT	O house of Jacob, come and let us walk In the light of the LORD.
OT	In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver And his idols of gold, Which they made, each for himself to worship, To the moles and bats,
OT	The mighty man and the man of war, The judge and the prophet, And the diviner and the elder;
OT	The LORD stands up to plead, And stands to judge the people.
OT	When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purged the blood of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning,
OT	For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah are His pleasant plant. He looked for justice, but behold, oppression; For righteousness, but behold, a cry for help.
OT	In my hearing the LORD of hosts said, "Truly, many houses shall be desolate, Great and beautiful ones, without inhabitant.
OT	Whose arrows are sharp, And all their bows bent; Their horses' hooves will seem like flint, And their wheels like a whirlwind.
OT	Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
OT	The LORD has removed men far away, And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
OT	And it was told to the house of David, saying, "Syria's forces are deployed in Ephraim." So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.
OT	and say to him: "Take heed, and be quiet; do not fear or be fainthearted for these two stubs of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and the son of Remaliah.
OT	For You have broken the yoke of his burden And the staff of his shoulder, The rod of his oppressor, As in the day of Midian.
OT	Then the rest of the trees of his forest Will be so few in number That a child may write them.
OT	And it shall come to pass in that day That the remnant of Israel, And such as have escaped of the house of Jacob, Will never again depend on him who defeated them, But will depend on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
OT	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: "O My people, who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian. He shall strike you with a rod and lift up his staff against you, in the manner of Egypt.
OT	His delight is in the fear of the LORD, And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, Nor decide by the hearing of His ears;
OT	Their children also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished.
OT	"All the kings of the nations, All of them, sleep in glory, Everyone in his own house;
OT	Prepare slaughter for his children Because of the iniquity of their fathers, Lest they rise up and possess the land, And fill the face of the world with cities."
OT	In mercy the throne will be established; And One will sit on it in truth, in the tabernacle of David, Judging and seeking justice and hastening righteousness."
OT	For the fields of Heshbon languish, And the vine of Sibmah; The lords of the nations have broken down its choice plants, Which have reached to Jazer And wandered through the wilderness. Her branches are stretched out, They are gone over the sea.
OT	Gladness is taken away, And joy from the plentiful field; In the vineyards there will be no singing, Nor will there be shouting; No treaders will tread out wine in the presses; I have made their shouting cease.
OT	"In that day it shall come to pass That the glory of Jacob will wane, And the fatness of his flesh grow lean.
OT	Then behold, at eventide, trouble! And before the morning, he is no more. This is the portion of those who plunder us, And the lot of those who rob us.
OT	They will be left together for the mountain birds of prey And for the beasts of the earth; The birds of prey will summer on them, And all the beasts of the earth will winter on them.
OT	Neither will there be any work for Egypt, Which the head or tail, Palm branch or bulrush, may do.
OT	Then the LORD will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day, and will make sacrifice and offering; yes, they will make a vow to the LORD and perform it.
OT	Then the LORD said, "Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia,
OT	Prepare the table, Set a watchman in the tower, Eat and drink. Arise, you princes, Anoint the shield!
OT	He will surely turn violently and toss you like a ball Into a large country; There you shall die, and there your glorious chariots Shall be the shame of your master's house.
OT	"Then it shall be in that day, That I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;
OT	Now it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
OT	The foot shall tread it down--The feet of the poor And the steps of the needy."
OT	So it shall be in that day: The great trumpet will be blown; They will come, who are about to perish in the land of Assyria, And they who are outcasts in the land of Egypt, And shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
OT	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, Will be trampled underfoot;
OT	Also I will make justice the measuring line, And righteousness the plummet; The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, And the waters will overflow the hiding place.
OT	Now therefore, do not be mockers, Lest your bonds be made strong; For I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts, A destruction determined even upon the whole earth.
OT	For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing sledge, Nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cummin; But the black cummin is beaten out with a stick, And the cummin with a rod.
OT	"Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! Add year to year; Let feasts come around.
OT	Woe to those who seek deep to hide their counsel far from the LORD, And their works are in the dark; They say, "Who sees us?" and, "Who knows us?"
OT	Who walk to go down to Egypt, And have not asked My advice, To strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, And to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
OT	They were all ashamed of a people who could not benefit them, Or be help or benefit, But a shame and also a reproach."
OT	The burden against the beasts of the South. Through a land of trouble and anguish, From which came the lioness and lion, The viper and fiery flying serpent, They will carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys, And their treasures on the humps of camels, To a people who shall not profit;
OT	For thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: "In returning and rest you shall be saved; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength." But you would not,
OT	And though the Lord gives you The bread of adversity and the water of affliction, Yet your teachers will not be moved into a corner anymore, But your eyes shall see your teachers.
OT	You will also defile the covering of your images of silver, And the ornament of your molded images of gold. You will throw them away as an unclean thing; You will say to them, "Get away!"
OT	For through the voice of the LORD Assyria will be beaten down, As He strikes with the rod.
OT	For thus the LORD has spoken to me: "As a lion roars, And a young lion over his prey (When a multitude of shepherds is summoned against him, He will not be afraid of their voice Nor be disturbed by their noise), So the LORD of hosts will come down To fight for Mount Zion and for its hill.
OT	For the foolish person will speak foolishness, And his heart will work iniquity: To practice ungodliness, To utter error against the LORD, To keep the hungry unsatisfied, And he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
OT	Tremble, you women who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent ones; Strip yourselves, make yourselves bare, And gird sackcloth on your waists.
OT	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
OT	Your tackle is loosed, They could not strengthen their mast, They could not spread the sail. Then the prey of great plunder is divided; The lame take the prey.
OT	For the indignation of the LORD is against all nations, And His fury against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them, He has given them over to the slaughter.
OT	"For My sword shall be bathed in heaven; Indeed it shall come down on Edom, And on the people of My curse, for judgment.
OT	There the arrow snake shall make her nest and lay eggs And hatch, and gather them under her shadow; There also shall the hawks be gathered, Every one with her mate.
OT	And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.
OT	Have I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, "Go up against this land, and destroy it."'
OT	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
OT	Then the Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish.
OT	Then Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying:
OT	Therefore their inhabitants had little power; They were dismayed and confounded; They were as the grass of the field And the green herb, As the grass on the housetops And grain blighted before it is grown.
OT	And this is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing which He has spoken:
OT	I said, "In the prime of my life I shall go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the remainder of my years."
OT	I said, "I shall not see Yah, The LORD in the land of the living; I shall observe man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
OT	Why do you say, O Jacob, And speak, O Israel: "My way is hidden from the LORD, And my just claim is passed over by my God"?
OT	The coastlands saw it and feared, The ends of the earth were afraid; They drew near and came.
OT	The first time I said to Zion, "Look, there they are!' And I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good tidings.
OT	"I, the LORD, have called You in righteousness, And will hold Your hand; I will keep You and give You as a covenant to the people, As a light to the Gentiles,
OT	The LORD is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will exalt the law and make it honorable.
OT	But this is a people robbed and plundered; All of them are snared in holes, And they are hidden in prison houses; They are for prey, and no one delivers; For plunder, and no one says, "Restore!"
OT	"Do not remember the former things, Nor consider the things of old.
OT	Behold, I will do a new thing, Now it shall spring forth; Shall you not know it? I will even make a road in the wilderness And rivers in the desert.
OT	"But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob; And you have been weary of Me, O Israel.
OT	You have bought Me no sweet cane with money, Nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices; But you have burdened Me with your sins, You have wearied Me with your iniquities.
OT	He burns half of it in the fire; With this half he eats meat; He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. He even warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire."
OT	"Woe to him who strives with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him who forms it, "What are you making?' Or shall your handiwork say, "He has no hands'?
OT	Thus says the LORD: "The labor of Egypt and merchandise of Cush And of the Sabeans, men of stature, Shall come over to you, and they shall be yours; They shall walk behind you, They shall come over in chains; And they shall bow down to you. They will make supplication to you, saying, "Surely God is in you, And there is no other; There is no other God."'
OT	For thus says the LORD, Who created the heavens, Who is God, Who formed the earth and made it, Who has established it, Who did not create it in vain, Who formed it to be inhabited: "I am the LORD, and there is no other.
OT	"To whom will you liken Me, and make Me equal And compare Me, that we should be alike?
OT	They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it And set it in its place, and it stands; From its place it shall not move. Though one cries out to it, yet it cannot answer Nor save him out of his trouble.
OT	Remember the former things of old, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me,
OT	"Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, Who are far from righteousness:
OT	"Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; For you shall no longer be called The Lady of Kingdoms.
OT	But these two things shall come to you In a moment, in one day: The loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come upon you in their fullness Because of the multitude of your sorceries, For the great abundance of your enchantments.
OT	Because I knew that you were obstinate, And your neck was an iron sinew, And your brow bronze,
OT	"Listen to Me, O Jacob, And Israel, My called: I am He, I am the First, I am also the Last.
OT	Then I said, "I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and in vain; Yet surely my just reward is with the LORD, And my work with my God."'
OT	They shall neither hunger nor thirst, Neither heat nor sun shall strike them; For He who has mercy on them will lead them, Even by the springs of water He will guide them.
OT	Your sons shall make haste; Your destroyers and those who laid you waste Shall go away from you.
OT	The Lord GOD has opened My ear; And I was not rebellious, Nor did I turn away.
OT	He is near who justifies Me; Who will contend with Me? Let us stand together. Who is My adversary? Let him come near Me.
OT	"Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, You people in whose heart is My law: Do not fear the reproach of men, Nor be afraid of their insults.
OT	Shake yourself from the dust, arise; Sit down, O Jerusalem! Loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion!
OT	Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, And He shall divide the spoil with the strong, Because He poured out His soul unto death, And He was numbered with the transgressors, And He bore the sin of many, And made intercession for the transgressors.
OT	For you shall expand to the right and to the left, And your descendants will inherit the nations, And make the desolate cities inhabited.
OT	I will make your pinnacles of rubies, Your gates of crystal, And all your walls of precious stones.
OT	No weapon formed against you shall prosper, And every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their righteousness is from Me," Says the LORD.
OT	"Also the sons of the foreigner Who join themselves to the LORD, to serve Him, And to love the name of the LORD, to be His servants--Everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, And holds fast My covenant--
OT	Even them I will bring to My holy mountain, And make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices Will be accepted on My altar; For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations."
OT	All you beasts of the field, come to devour, All you beasts in the forest.
OT	For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid and was angry, And he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
OT	Yet they seek Me daily, And delight to know My ways, As a nation that did righteousness, And did not forsake the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; They take delight in approaching God.
OT	"If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, From doing your pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a delight, The holy day of the LORD honorable, And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, Nor finding your own pleasure, Nor speaking your own words,
OT	We all growl like bears, And moan sadly like doves; We look for justice, but there is none; For salvation, but it is far from us.
OT	For our transgressions are multiplied before You, And our sins testify against us; For our transgressions are with us, And as for our iniquities, we know them:
OT	So truth fails, And he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Then the LORD saw it, and it displeased Him That there was no justice.
OT	According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay, Fury to His adversaries, Recompense to His enemies; The coastlands He will fully repay.
OT	For the nation and kingdom which will not serve you shall perish, And those nations shall be utterly ruined.

OT	Their descendants shall be known among the Gentiles, And their offspring among the people. All who see them shall acknowledge them, That they are the posterity whom the LORD has blessed."
OT	The Gentiles shall see your righteousness, And all kings your glory. You shall be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the LORD will name.
OT	As fire burns brushwood, As fire causes water to boil--To make Your name known to Your adversaries, That the nations may tremble at Your presence!
OT	But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, And her people a joy.
OT	They shall not build and another inhabit; They shall not plant and another eat; For as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of My people, And My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
OT	Then they shall bring all your brethren for an offering to the LORD out of all nations, on horses and in chariots and in litters, on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
OT	Thus says the LORD: "What injustice have your fathers found in Me, That they have gone far from Me, Have followed idols, And have become idolaters?
OT	"Is Israel a servant? Is he a homeborn slave? Why is he plundered?
OT	Have you not brought this on yourself, In that you have forsaken the LORD your God When He led you in the way?
OT	And now why take the road to Egypt, To drink the waters of Sihor? Or why take the road to Assyria, To drink the waters of the River?
OT	Your own wickedness will correct you, And your backslidings will rebuke you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing That you have forsaken the LORD your God, And the fear of Me is not in you," Says the Lord GOD of hosts.
OT	"For of old I have broken your yoke and burst your bonds; And you said, "I will not transgress,' When on every high hill and under every green tree You lay down, playing the harlot.

OT	"And it shall come to pass in that day," says the LORD, "That the heart of the king shall perish, And the heart of the princes; The priests shall be astonished, And the prophets shall wonder."

OT	Destruction upon destruction is cried, For the whole land is plundered. Suddenly my tents are plundered, And my curtains in a moment.
OT	"And when you are plundered, What will you do? Though you clothe yourself with crimson, Though you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, Though you enlarge your eyes with paint, In vain you will make yourself fair; Your lovers will despise you; They will seek your life.
OT	"For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor, The anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, The voice of the daughter of Zion bewailing herself; She spreads her hands, saying, "Woe is me now, for my soul is weary Because of murderers!'
OT	I will go to the great men and speak to them, For they have known the way of the LORD, The judgment of their God." But these have altogether broken the yoke And burst the bonds.
OT	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah Have dealt very treacherously with Me," says the LORD.
OT	They have grown fat, they are sleek; Yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked; They do not plead the cause, The cause of the fatherless; Yet they prosper, And the right of the needy they do not defend.
OT	Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul depart from you; Lest I make you desolate, A land not inhabited."
OT	To whom shall I speak and give warning, That they may hear? Indeed their ear is uncircumcised, And they cannot give heed. Behold, the word of the LORD is a reproach to them; They have no delight in it.
OT	And their houses shall be turned over to others, Fields and wives together; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land," says the LORD.
OT	Hear, O earth! Behold, I will certainly bring calamity on this people--The fruit of their thoughts, Because they have not heeded My words Nor My law, but rejected it.
OT	Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat meat.
OT	For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
OT	For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight," says the LORD. "They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to pollute it.
OT	They shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked, which they have sought and which they have worshiped. They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be like refuse on the face of the earth.
OT	I would comfort myself in sorrow; My heart is faint in me.
OT	Oh, that I had in the wilderness A lodging place for travelers; That I might leave my people, And go from them! For they are all adulterers, An assembly of treacherous men.
OT	Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will refine them and try them; For how shall I deal with the daughter of My people?

OT	Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, Let not the mighty man glory in his might, Nor let the rich man glory in his riches;
OT	For the customs of the peoples are futile; For one cuts a tree from the forest, The work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.
OT	They decorate it with silver and gold; They fasten it with nails and hammers So that it will not topple.
OT	But they are altogether dull-hearted and foolish; A wooden idol is a worthless doctrine.
OT	Woe is me for my hurt! My wound is severe. But I say, "Truly this is an infirmity, And I must bear it."
OT	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
OT	"For the LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced doom against you for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering incense to Baal."
OT	My heritage is to Me like a lion in the forest; It cries out against Me; Therefore I have hated it.
OT	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
OT	"Thus says the LORD: "In this manner I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
OT	"Then you shall say to them, "Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land--even the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem--with drunkenness!

OT	What will you say when He punishes you? For you have taught them To be chieftains, to be head over you. Will not pangs seize you, Like a woman in labor?
OT	The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts.
OT	Their nobles have sent their lads for water; They went to the cisterns and found no water. They returned with their vessels empty; They were ashamed and confounded And covered their heads.
OT	Yes, the deer also gave birth in the field, But left because there was no grass.
OT	And the LORD said to me, "The prophets prophesy lies in My name. I have not sent them, commanded them, nor spoken to them; they prophesy to you a false vision, divination, a worthless thing, and the deceit of their heart.

OT	I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give every man according to his ways, According to the fruit of his doings.
OT	As for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd who follows You, Nor have I desired the woeful day; You know what came out of my lips; It was right there before You.
OT	and say to them, "Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates.
OT	And they shall come from the cities of Judah and from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the lowland, from the mountains and from the South, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of the LORD.
OT	"Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, "Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I am fashioning a disaster and devising a plan against you. Return now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.'
OT	"Because My people have forgotten Me, They have burned incense to worthless idols. And they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways, From the ancient paths, To walk in pathways and not on a highway,
OT	Then they said, "Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us attack him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words."
OT	Yet, LORD, You know all their counsel Which is against me, to slay me. Provide no atonement for their iniquity, Nor blot out their sin from Your sight; But let them be overthrown before You. Deal thus with them In the time of Your anger.
OT	Thus I will do to this place," says the LORD, "and to its inhabitants, and make this city like Tophet.
OT	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to other gods.'
OT	For when I spoke, I cried out; I shouted, "Violence and plunder!" Because the word of the LORD was made to me A reproach and a derision daily.
OT	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; Then it was well. Was not this knowing Me?" says the LORD.
OT	"Yet your eyes and your heart are for nothing but your covetousness, For shedding innocent blood, And practicing oppression and violence."
OT	"Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, And lift up your voice in Bashan; Cry from Abarim, For all your lovers are destroyed.

OT	I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor shall they be lacking," says the LORD.
OT	But if they had stood in My counsel, And had caused My people to hear My words, Then they would have turned them from their evil way And from the evil of their doings.
OT	"Is not My word like a fire?" says the LORD, "And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
OT	"And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, "The oracle of the LORD!' I will even punish that man and his house.
OT	Thus you shall say to the prophet, "What has the LORD answered you?' and, "What has the LORD spoken?'
OT	But since you say, "The oracle of the LORD!' therefore thus says the LORD: "Because you say this word, "The oracle of the LORD!" and I have sent to you, saying, "Do not say, "The oracle of the LORD!"'
OT	Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not harm you.'
OT	(For many nations and great kings shall be served by them also; and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.)"'
OT	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people;
OT	all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are across the sea;
OT	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, And a wailing of the leaders to the flock will be heard. For the LORD has plundered their pasture,
OT	And the peaceful dwellings are cut down Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
OT	So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
OT	Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.

OT	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem--
OT	For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. I have given him the beasts of the field also.'
OT	Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who were carried away captive, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
OT	because they have not heeded My words, says the LORD, which I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; neither would you heed, says the LORD.
OT	Now Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
OT	Send to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I have not sent him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie--
OT	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
OT	For behold, the days are coming,' says the LORD, "that I will bring back from captivity My people Israel and Judah,' says the LORD. "And I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it."'

OT	"Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob's tents, And have mercy on his dwelling places; The city shall be built upon its own mound, And the palace shall remain according to its own plan.
OT	In those days they shall say no more: "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth are set on edge.'
OT	For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land."'
OT	You have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
OT	Therefore thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
OT	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger--they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
OT	"Thus says the LORD who made it, the LORD who formed it to establish it (the LORD is His name):
OT	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who will say: "Praise the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His mercy endures forever"--and of those who will bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captives of the land to return as at the first,' says the LORD.

OT	"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: "Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, "Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
OT	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
OT	"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: "I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
OT	Then you turned around and profaned My name, and every one of you brought back his male and female slaves, whom he had set at liberty, at their pleasure, and brought them back into subjection, to be your male and female slaves.'
OT	It may be that they will present their supplication before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
OT	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the book,
OT	And they asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us now, how did you write all these words--at his instruction?"
OT	And they went to the king, into the court; but they stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the hearing of the king.
OT	Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning on the hearth before him.
OT	And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that the king cut it with the scribe's knife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
OT	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
OT	But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to the words of the LORD which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
OT	Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison.
OT	For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise up, every man in his tent, and burn the city with fire."'
OT	that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people.
OT	Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.
OT	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah to the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
OT	Thus says the LORD: "This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it."'
OT	Therefore the princes said to the king, "Please, let this man be put to death, for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm."
OT	Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with bronze fetters to carry him off to Babylon.
OT	"Go and speak to Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will bring My words upon this city for adversity and not for good, and they shall be performed in that day before you.
OT	But I will deliver you in that day," says the LORD, "and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
OT	And now look, I free you this day from the chains that were on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if it seems wrong for you to come with me to Babylon, remain here. See, all the land is before you; wherever it seems good and convenient for you to go, go there."
OT	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah,
OT	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely concerning Ishmael."
OT	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
OT	But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not kill us, for we have treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field." So he desisted and did not kill them among their brethren.
OT	So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.'
OT	"The LORD has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, "Do not go to Egypt!' Know certainly that I have admonished you this day.
OT	"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will set My face against you for catastrophe and for cutting off all Judah.
OT	so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall escape or survive, lest they return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return and dwell. For none shall return except those who escape."'
OT	So the LORD could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you committed. Therefore your land is a desolation, an astonishment, a curse, and without an inhabitant, as it is this day.
OT	Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: "You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands, saying, "We will surely keep our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her." You will surely keep your vows and perform your vows!'
OT	Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: "Behold, I have sworn by My great name,' says the LORD, "that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, "The Lord GOD lives."
OT	He made many fall; Yes, one fell upon another. And they said, "Arise! Let us go back to our own people And to the land of our nativity From the oppressing sword.'
OT	Thus says the LORD: "Behold, waters rise out of the north, And shall be an overflowing flood; They shall overflow the land and all that is in it, The city and those who dwell within; Then the men shall cry, And all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
OT	"Moab has been at ease from his youth; He has settled on his dregs, And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, Nor has he gone into captivity. Therefore his taste remained in him, And his scent has not changed.
OT	"Make him drunk, Because he exalted himself against the LORD. Moab shall wallow in his vomit, And he shall also be in derision.
OT	"From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh and to Jahaz They have uttered their voice, From Zoar to Horonaim, Like a three-year-old heifer; For the waters of Nimrim also shall be desolate.
OT	"For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped; On all the hands shall be cuts, and on the loins sackcloth--
OT	Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh perish; For your sons have been taken captive, And your daughters captive.
OT	For thus says the LORD: "Behold, those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunk. And are you the one who will altogether go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink of it.
OT	For I have sworn by Myself," says the LORD, "that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. And all its cities shall be perpetual wastes."

OT	"A sword is against the Chaldeans," says the LORD, "Against the inhabitants of Babylon, And against her princes and her wise men.
OT	A drought is against her waters, and they will be dried up. For it is the land of carved images, And they are insane with their idols.

OT	For because of the anger of the LORD this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, till He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
OT	The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under it, and the carts, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD--the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.
OT	Now concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow.
OT	Her adversaries have become the master, Her enemies prosper; For the LORD has afflicted her Because of the multitude of her transgressions. Her children have gone into captivity before the enemy.
OT	In the days of her affliction and roaming, Jerusalem remembers all her pleasant things That she had in the days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, With no one to help her, The adversaries saw her And mocked at her downfall.
OT	He has done violence to His tabernacle, As if it were a garden; He has destroyed His place of assembly; The LORD has caused The appointed feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion. In His burning indignation He has spurned the king and the priest.
OT	The LORD has purposed to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line; He has not withdrawn His hand from destroying; Therefore He has caused the rampart and wall to lament; They languished together.
OT	The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground and keep silence; They throw dust on their heads And gird themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Bow their heads to the ground.
OT	All your enemies have opened their mouth against you; They hiss and gnash their teeth. They say, "We have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day we have waited for; We have found it, we have seen it!|"
OT	Even when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer.
OT	You have moved my soul far from peace; I have forgotten prosperity.
OT	And I said, "My strength and my hope Have perished from the LORD."
OT	This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope.
OT	My eyes overflow with rivers of water For the destruction of the daughter of my people.
OT	You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me.
OT	Even the jackals present their breasts To nurse their young; But the daughter of my people is cruel, Like ostriches in the wilderness.
OT	Our fathers sinned and are no more, But we bear their iniquities.
OT	They ravished the women in Zion, The maidens in the cities of Judah.
OT	As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.
OT	Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies.
OT	Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
OT	As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse--for they are a rebellious house--yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.
OT	Then He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.
OT	I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous noise.
OT	When I say to the wicked, "You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.
OT	Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
OT	So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.
OT	Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
OT	And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.
OT	One-third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and one-third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter another third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
OT	"So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a lesson, and an astonishment to the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments among you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken.
OT	So I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. Then they shall know that I am the LORD."
OT	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.
OT	Then He said to them, "Defile the temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!" And they went out and killed in the city.
OT	Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.
OT	Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, "Speak! "Thus says the LORD: "Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.
OT	You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you," says the Lord GOD.
OT	that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.
OT	Then the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.
OT	For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
OT	"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, "Hear the word of the LORD!"'
OT	"Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity. Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them?
OT	that I may seize the house of Israel by their heart, because they are all estranged from Me by their idols."'
OT	that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God," says the Lord GOD."'
OT	And they will comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause that I have done in it," says the Lord GOD.
OT	"Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
OT	You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them.
OT	that you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself in every street.
OT	So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.
OT	And I will establish My covenant with you. Then you shall know that I am the LORD,
OT	Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons.
OT	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "As I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense on his own head.
OT	He roved among the lions, And became a young lion; He learned to catch prey; He devoured men.
OT	Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side, And spread their net over him; He was trapped in their pit.
OT	Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
OT	"Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, "Thus says the Lord GOD: "In this too your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being unfaithful to Me.
OT	"As I live," says the Lord GOD, "surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.
OT	Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have dealt with you for My name's sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel," says the Lord GOD."'
OT	Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! They say of me, "Does he not speak parables?"'
OT	"Swords at the ready! Thrust right! Set your blade! Thrust left--Wherever your edge is ordered!
OT	"And son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to go; both of them shall go from the same land. Make a sign; put it at the head of the road to the city.
OT	Overthrown, overthrown, I will make it overthrown! It shall be no longer, Until He comes whose right it is, And I will give it to Him."'
OT	While they see false visions for you, While they divine a lie to you, To bring you on the necks of the wicked, the slain Whose day has come, Whose iniquity shall end.
OT	I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the countries, and remove your filthiness completely from you.
OT	"Son of man, there were two women, The daughters of one mother.
OT	Girded with belts around their waists, Flowing turbans on their heads, All of them looking like captains, In the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, The land of their nativity.
OT	"Yet she multiplied her harlotry In calling to remembrance the days of her youth, When she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
OT	Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, When the Egyptians pressed your bosom Because of your youthful breasts.
OT	"Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, From whom you have alienated yourself, And I will bring them against you from every side:
OT	The assembly shall stone them with stones and execute them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
OT	Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
OT	In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, You will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, Till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.
OT	therefore, behold, I will clear the territory of Moab of cities, of the cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kirjathaim.
OT	With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.
OT	"Now, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre,
OT	Your borders are in the midst of the seas. Your builders have perfected your beauty.
OT	"Tarshish was your merchant because of your many luxury goods. They gave you silver, iron, tin, and lead for your goods.
OT	Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.
OT	"The ships of Tarshish were carriers of your merchandise. You were filled and very glorious in the midst of the seas.
OT	In their wailing for you They will take up a lamentation, And lament for you: "What city is like Tyre, Destroyed in the midst of the sea?
OT	They shall throw you down into the Pit, And you shall die the death of the slain In the midst of the seas.
OT	"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.
OT	"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Surely I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast.
OT	And the land of Egypt shall become desolate and waste; then they will know that I am the LORD, because he said, "The River is mine, and I have made it.'
OT	No longer shall it be the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of their iniquity when they turned to follow them. Then they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.'
OT	The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
OT	The sword shall come upon Egypt, And great anguish shall be in Ethiopia, When the slain fall in Egypt, And they take away her wealth, And her foundations are broken down.
OT	"Thus says the Lord GOD: "I will also destroy the idols, And cause the images to cease from Noph; There shall no longer be princes from the land of Egypt; I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
OT	I will pour My fury on Sin, the strength of Egypt; I will cut off the multitude of No,
OT	And aliens, the most terrible of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it.
OT	"So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them. "For they have all been delivered to death, To the depths of the earth, Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.'
OT	"Thus says the Lord GOD: "In the day when it went down to hell, I caused mourning. I covered the deep because of it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it.
OT	All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, And bring darkness upon your land,' Says the Lord GOD.
OT	Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.'
OT	when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people,
OT	But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.'
OT	Say to them: "As I live,' says the Lord GOD, "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?'
OT	Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
OT	So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their hearts pursue their own gain.
OT	"For thus says the Lord GOD: "Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.
OT	As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.
OT	And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them afraid.
OT	therefore, as I live," says the Lord GOD, "I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.
OT	"Because you have said, "These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them,' although the LORD was there,
OT	therefore, as I live," says the Lord GOD, "I will do according to your anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
OT	As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you; you shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom--all of it! Then they shall know that I am the LORD."'
OT	"Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, "Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations."
OT	So I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the countries; I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
OT	I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
OT	"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, "Thus says the Lord GOD: "On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it?
OT	"It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will obstruct travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude. Therefore they will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog.
OT	Each gate chamber was one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate was one rod.
OT	He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
OT	On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width.
OT	After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements.
OT	Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways were according to these same measurements; there were windows in it and in its archways all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
OT	There were archways all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
OT	Its archways faced the outer court, palm trees were on its gateposts, and going up to it were eight steps.
OT	There was a chamber and its entrance by the gateposts of the gateway, where they washed the burnt offering.
OT	Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables.
OT	The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
OT	There were beveled window frames and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the vestibule--also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies.
OT	Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
OT	And a wall which was outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits.
OT	And He said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: "These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.
OT	When these days are over it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you,' says the Lord GOD."
OT	Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; so I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD; and I fell on my face.
OT	And they shall not come near Me to minister to Me as priest, nor come near any of My holy things, nor into the Most Holy Place; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.
OT	Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the temple, for all its work, and for all that has to be done in it.
OT	"They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to minister to Me, and they shall keep My charge.
OT	It shall be a holy section of the land, belonging to the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD; it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
OT	"You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand long, adjacent to the district of the holy section; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
OT	"All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.
OT	"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
OT	"Thus says the Lord GOD: "The gateway of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened.
OT	The prince shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
OT	"Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to the LORD, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened for him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.
OT	He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.
OT	To these--to the priests--the holy district shall belong: on the north twenty-five thousand cubits in length, on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. The sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the center.
OT	The common-land of the city shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.
OT	by the border of Gad, on the south side, toward the South, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea.
OT	(the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel), the three gates northward: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate for Levi;
OT	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the articles of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god.
OT	And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king's delicacies.
OT	As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
OT	Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.
OT	And the king said to them, "I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream."
OT	The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, "There is not a man on earth who can tell the king's matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean.
OT	It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
OT	So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation.
OT	Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, "I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation."
OT	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
OT	But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.
OT	And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others.
OT	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him.
OT	that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up;
OT	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews.
OT	Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!
OT	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.
OT	In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
OT	Then Daniel answered, and said before the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
OT	PERES: Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
OT	That very night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was slain.
OT	So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. But the king spoke, saying to Daniel, "Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you."
OT	And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.
OT	"And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: "Arise, devour much flesh!'
OT	"I watched till thrones were put in place, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment was white as snow, And the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame, Its wheels a burning fire;
OT	and the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, before which three fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke pompous words, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.
OT	He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily sacrifices were taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast down.
OT	And he said, "Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end shall be.
OT	To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him.
OT	Therefore the LORD has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon us; for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works which He does, though we have not obeyed His voice.
OT	yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering.
OT	And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
OT	Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.
OT	Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision refers to many days yet to come."
OT	And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt, with their princes and their precious articles of silver and gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the North.
OT	"Also the king of the North shall come to the kingdom of the king of the South, but shall return to his own land.
OT	So the king of the North shall come and build a siege mound, and take a fortified city; and the forces of the South shall not withstand him. Even his choice troops shall have no strength to resist.
OT	But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and no one shall stand against him. He shall stand in the Glorious Land with destruction in his power.
OT	And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt.
OT	Then the LORD said to him: "Call his name Jezreel, For in a little while I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, And bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
OT	It shall come to pass in that day That I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel."
OT	I will give her her vineyards from there, And the Valley of Achor as a door of hope; She shall sing there, As in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.
OT	Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of the LORD for the children of Israel, who look to other gods and love the raisin cakes of the pagans."
OT	"Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Let not Judah offend. Do not come up to Gilgal, Nor go up to Beth Aven, Nor swear an oath, saying, "As the LORD lives'--
OT	"Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For yours is the judgment, Because you have been a snare to Mizpah And a net spread on Tabor.
OT	"With their flocks and herds They shall go to seek the LORD, But they will not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.
OT	Therefore I will be to Ephraim like a moth, And to the house of Judah like rottenness.
OT	"When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah saw his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb; Yet he cannot cure you, Nor heal you of your wound.
OT	As bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, So the company of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they commit lewdness.
OT	Israel will cry to Me, "My God, we know You!'
OT	"They set up kings, but not by Me; They made princes, but I did not acknowledge them. From their silver and gold They made idols for themselves--That they might be cut off.
OT	Israel is swallowed up; Now they are among the Gentiles Like a vessel in which is no pleasure.
OT	Israel empties his vine; He brings forth fruit for himself. According to the multitude of his fruit He has increased the altars; According to the bounty of his land They have embellished his sacred pillars.
OT	They have spoken words, Swearing falsely in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field.
OT	Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, Because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel Shall be cut off utterly.
OT	"He shall not return to the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to repent.
OT	"Ephraim feeds on the wind, And pursues the east wind; He daily increases lies and desolation. Also they make a covenant with the Assyrians, And oil is carried to Egypt.
OT	And Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors They shall find in me no iniquity that is sin.'
OT	I have also spoken by the prophets, And have multiplied visions; I have given symbols through the witness of the prophets."
OT	When they had pasture, they were filled; They were filled and their heart was exalted; Therefore they forgot Me.
OT	I gave you a king in My anger, And took him away in My wrath.
OT	For a nation has come up against My land, Strong, and without number; His teeth are the teeth of a lion, And he has the fangs of a fierce lion.
OT	The grain offering and the drink offering Have been cut off from the house of the LORD; The priests mourn, who minister to the LORD.
OT	With a noise like chariots Over mountaintops they leap, Like the noise of a flaming fire that devours the stubble, Like a strong people set in battle array.
OT	They do not push one another; Every one marches in his own column. Though they lunge between the weapons, They are not cut down.
OT	"Now, therefore," says the LORD, "Turn to Me with all your heart, With fasting, with weeping, and with mourning."
OT	So rend your heart, and not your garments; Return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, and of great kindness; And He relents from doing harm.
OT	You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; And My people shall never be put to shame.
OT	"And it shall come to pass afterward That I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions.
OT	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
OT	"So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain. Then Jerusalem shall be holy, And no aliens shall ever pass through her again."
OT	But I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, Which shall devour its palaces."
OT	Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of the people of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment, Because they ripped open the women with child in Gilead, That they might enlarge their territory.
OT	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, And it shall devour its palaces, Amid shouting in the day of battle, And a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
OT	"Behold, I am weighed down by you, As a cart full of sheaves is weighed down.
OT	The most courageous men of might Shall flee naked in that day," Says the LORD.
OT	Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:
OT	"That in the day I punish Israel for their transgressions, I will also visit destruction on the altars of Bethel; And the horns of the altar shall be cut off And fall to the ground.
OT	Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, Proclaim and announce the freewill offerings; For this you love, You children of Israel!" Says the Lord GOD.
OT	"I also withheld rain from you, When there were still three months to the harvest. I made it rain on one city, I withheld rain from another city. One part was rained upon, And where it did not rain the part withered.
OT	So two or three cities wandered to another city to drink water, But they were not satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me," Says the LORD.
OT	"I blasted you with blight and mildew. When your gardens increased, Your vineyards, Your fig trees, And your olive trees, The locust devoured them; Yet you have not returned to Me," Says the LORD.
OT	Therefore the LORD God of hosts, the Lord, says this: "There shall be wailing in all streets, And they shall say in all the highways, "Alas! Alas!' They shall call the farmer to mourning, And skillful lamenters to wailing.
OT	Take away from Me the noise of your songs, For I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments.
OT	Therefore they shall now go captive as the first of the captives, And those who recline at banquets shall be removed.
OT	Then I said: "O Lord GOD, cease, I pray! Oh, that Jacob may stand, For he is small!"
OT	Shall the land not tremble for this, And everyone mourn who dwells in it? All of it shall swell like the River, Heave and subside Like the River of Egypt.
OT	Though they go into captivity before their enemies, From there I will command the sword, And it shall slay them. I will set My eyes on them for harm and not for good."
OT	The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom (We have heard a report from the LORD, And a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying, "Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle"):
OT	"Oh, how Esau shall be searched out! How his hidden treasures shall be sought after!
OT	"For violence against your brother Jacob, Shame shall cover you, And you shall be cut off forever.
OT	"But you should not have gazed on the day of your brother In the day of his captivity; Nor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah In the day of their destruction; Nor should you have spoken proudly In the day of distress.
OT	You should not have entered the gate of My people In the day of their calamity. Indeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction In the day of their calamity, Nor laid hands on their substance In the day of their calamity.
OT	And the captives of this host of the children of Israel Shall possess the land of the Canaanites As far as Zarephath. The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad Shall possess the cities of the South.
OT	Then they said to him, "What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?"--for the sea was growing more tempestuous.

OT	I will cut off the cities of your land And throw down all your strongholds.
OT	O My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab counseled, And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, From Acacia Grove to Gilgal, That you may know the righteousness of the LORD."

OT	Therefore I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation; My God will hear me.
OT	"As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wonders."
OT	He who scatters has come up before your face. Man the fort! Watch the road! Strengthen your flanks! Fortify your power mightily.
OT	Because of the multitude of harlotries of the seductive harlot, The mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations through her harlotries, And families through her sorceries.
OT	It shall come to pass that all who look upon you Will flee from you, and say, "Nineveh is laid waste! Who will bemoan her?' Where shall I seek comforters for you?"
OT	Your commanders are like swarming locusts, And your generals like great grasshoppers, Which camp in the hedges on a cold day; When the sun rises they flee away, And the place where they are is not known.
OT	Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; Your nobles rest in the dust. Your people are scattered on the mountains, And no one gathers them.
OT	The burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw.
OT	Are You not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, You have appointed them for judgment; O Rock, You have marked them for correction.
OT	"But the LORD is in His holy temple. Let all the earth keep silence before Him."
OT	Though the fig tree may not blossom, Nor fruit be on the vines; Though the labor of the olive may fail, And the fields yield no food; Though the flock may be cut off from the fold, And there be no herd in the stalls--
OT	Therefore their goods shall become booty, And their houses a desolation; They shall build houses, but not inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards, but not drink their wine."
OT	Before the decree is issued, Or the day passes like chaff, Before the LORD's fierce anger comes upon you, Before the day of the LORD's anger comes upon you!
OT	Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: "I will destroy you; So there shall be no inhabitant."
OT	Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, To the oppressing city!

OT	"Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying: "This people says, "The time has not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.'
OT	Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider your ways!
OT	For I called for a drought on the land and the mountains, on the grain and the new wine and the oil, on whatever the ground brings forth, on men and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands."
OT	So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
OT	"And now, carefully consider from this day forward: from before stone was laid upon stone in the temple of the LORD--
OT	"Consider now from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid--consider it:
OT	Is the seed still in the barn? As yet the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yielded fruit. But from this day I will bless you."'
OT	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet:
OT	I am exceedingly angry with the nations at ease; For I was a little angry, And they helped--but with evil intent."
OT	"Up, up! Flee from the land of the north," says the LORD; "for I have spread you abroad like the four winds of heaven," says the LORD.
OT	"Hear, O Joshua, the high priest, You and your companions who sit before you, For they are a wondrous sign; For behold, I am bringing forth My Servant the BRANCH.
OT	Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
OT	And the angel answered and said to me, "These are four spirits of heaven, who go out from their station before the Lord of all the earth.
OT	Behold, the LORD will cast her out; He will destroy her power in the sea, And she will be devoured by fire.
OT	"A mixed race shall settle in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
OT	Return to the stronghold, You prisoners of hope. Even today I declare That I will restore double to you.
OT	He shall pass through the sea with affliction, And strike the waves of the sea: All the depths of the River shall dry up. Then the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, And the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
OT	In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place--Jerusalem.
OT	In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
OT	all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves.
OT	And it shall come to pass in all the land," Says the LORD, "That two-thirds in it shall be cut off and die, But one-third shall be left in it:
OT	Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts. Everyone who sacrifices shall come and take them and cook in them. In that day there shall no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
OT	"But now entreat God's favor, That He may be gracious to us. While this is being done by your hands, Will He accept you favorably?" Says the LORD of hosts.
OT	Yet you say, "For what reason?" Because the LORD has been witness Between you and the wife of your youth, With whom you have dealt treacherously; Yet she is your companion And your wife by covenant.
OT	"Your words have been harsh against Me," Says the LORD, "Yet you say, "What have we spoken against You?'
NT	Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.
NT	Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.
NT	"A voice was heard in Ramah, Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, Refusing to be comforted, Because they are no more."
NT	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
NT	Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
NT	And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.
NT	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.
NT	"You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.'
NT	But let your "Yes' be "Yes,' and your "No,'"No.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.
NT	"Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.
NT	And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.
NT	Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
NT	"But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand:
NT	Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed that same hour.
NT	But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
NT	And He said to them, "Go." So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.
NT	Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you."
NT	For which is easier, to say, "Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, "Arise and walk'?
NT	While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live."
NT	Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
NT	You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
NT	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
NT	Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
NT	And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
NT	and said to Him, "Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?"
NT	But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
NT	But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."
NT	But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:
NT	Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.
NT	If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
NT	Or how can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
NT	"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.
NT	Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
NT	But He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
NT	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
NT	On the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
NT	Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
NT	He said to them, "An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, "Do you want us then to go and gather them up?'
NT	The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
NT	Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
NT	who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
NT	Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?
NT	So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, "Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter."
NT	But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
NT	So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.
NT	When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
NT	But you say, "Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God"--
NT	Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."
NT	But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
NT	So Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding?
NT	Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
NT	Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
NT	Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there.
NT	And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.
NT	Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
NT	and in the morning, "It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
NT	Jesus answered and said to them, "Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.
NT	And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,
NT	Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you."
NT	Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!
NT	"Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.
NT	And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.
NT	His disciples said to Him, "If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
NT	And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,
NT	Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.
NT	But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to Him, "We are able."
NT	So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
NT	Then the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
NT	Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry.
NT	For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterward relent and believe him.
NT	Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.
NT	And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."
NT	"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.
NT	The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,
NT	Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her."
NT	This is the first and great commandment.
NT	saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
NT	But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.
NT	Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
NT	And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
NT	And Jesus answered and said to them: "Take heed that no one deceives you.
NT	"Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
NT	Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.
NT	Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods.
NT	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
NT	But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord's money.
NT	His lord said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
NT	So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.
NT	for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;
NT	"You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
NT	and said, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?" And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.
NT	So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
NT	The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
NT	But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."
NT	Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And so said all the disciples.
NT	And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
NT	Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
NT	Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done."
NT	Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
NT	But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."
NT	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
NT	Then the governor said, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they cried out all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!"
NT	Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said,
NT	Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,
NT	His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
NT	And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you."
NT	Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me."
NT	Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
NT	saying, "Tell them, "His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.'
NT	And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
NT	I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
NT	Immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.
NT	And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
NT	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
NT	And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once,
NT	But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, "Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?
NT	The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
NT	And Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.
NT	So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him.
NT	For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to touch Him.
NT	And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
NT	but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation"--
NT	because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."
NT	For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother."
NT	And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it.
NT	But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred."
NT	And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
NT	But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred."
NT	For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.
NT	For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
NT	who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains,
NT	Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were overcome with great amazement.
NT	Then He went out from there and came to His own country, and His disciples followed Him.
NT	But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house."
NT	But when Herod heard, he said, "This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!"
NT	For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her.
NT	Because John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
NT	Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.
NT	But He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." And when they found out they said, "Five, and two fish."
NT	When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there.
NT	For Moses said, "Honor your father and your mother'; and, "He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.'
NT	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
NT	All these evil things come from within and defile a man."
NT	So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
NT	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat.
NT	He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ."
NT	Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
NT	Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--
NT	Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
NT	And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."
NT	Then the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him. And he became as one dead, so that many said, "He is dead."
NT	And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all."
NT	And He answered and said to them, "What did Moses command you?"
NT	and they will mock Him, and scourge Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again."
NT	Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask."
NT	And He said to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
NT	but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared."
NT	So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. Then they called the blind man, saying to him, "Be of good cheer. Rise, He is calling you."
NT	So Jesus answered and said to him, "What do you want Me to do for you?" The blind man said to Him, "Rabboni, that I may receive my sight."
NT	Now when they drew near Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples;
NT	Then those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: "Hosanna! "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!'
NT	And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
NT	Then He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.
NT	And they sought to lay hands on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away.
NT	Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see it."
NT	Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, "Which is the first commandment of all?"
NT	Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." But after that no one dared question Him.
NT	Then He said to them in His teaching, "Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces,
NT	"Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things will be fulfilled?"
NT	For many will come in My name, saying, "I am He,' and will deceive many.
NT	And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
NT	So you also, when you see these things happening, know that it is near--at the doors!
NT	"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
NT	And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head.
NT	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to Him one by one, "Is it I?" And another said, "Is it I?"
NT	And He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will."
NT	Then He came the third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
NT	Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand."
NT	And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
NT	Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him and lead Him away safely."
NT	But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are saying." And he went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed.
NT	Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, "Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!"
NT	But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.
NT	For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.
NT	And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His head,
NT	With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left.
NT	Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
NT	Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
NT	But go, tell His disciples--and Peter--that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you."
NT	And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
NT	just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,
NT	And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
NT	And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
NT	But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was.
NT	Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,
NT	And Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,
NT	His mother answered and said, "No; he shall be called John."
NT	"Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited and redeemed His people,
NT	To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of their sins,
NT	Through the tender mercy of our God, With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;
NT	And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger."
NT	Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.
NT	For my eyes have seen Your salvation
NT	Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against
NT	Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
NT	And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
NT	And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.
NT	He answered and said to them, "He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."
NT	Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ or not,
NT	His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire."
NT	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,
NT	Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
NT	Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
NT	And Jesus answered and said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve."'
NT	And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
NT	To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD."
NT	But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;
NT	Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
NT	When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, "Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."
NT	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
NT	So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.
NT	Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him.
NT	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
NT	Which is easier, to say, "Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, "Rise up and walk'?
NT	Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that He went through the grainfields. And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate them, rubbing them in their hands.
NT	But they were filled with rage, and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
NT	"Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
NT	And He spoke a parable to them: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?
NT	He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock.
NT	"for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue."
NT	When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."
NT	This is he of whom it is written: "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.'
NT	Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd.
NT	And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.
NT	And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs.
NT	Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.
NT	Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,
NT	And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them."
NT	And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
NT	So they all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.
NT	And it happened, as He was alone praying, that His disciples joined Him, and He asked them, saying, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
NT	Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying, "Teacher, I implore You, look on my son, for he is my only child.
NT	And another also said, "Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house."
NT	Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."
NT	for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it."
NT	And forgive us our sins, For we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one."
NT	And He said to them, "Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves;
NT	I say to you, though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as many as he needs.
NT	But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls.
NT	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
NT	When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner.
NT	"But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass by justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.
NT	For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."
NT	Then Peter said to Him, "Lord, do You speak this parable only to us, or to all people?"
NT	Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
NT	Truly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he has.
NT	Then He also said to the multitudes, "Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, "A shower is coming'; and so it is.
NT	When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make every effort along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
NT	And again He said, "To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
NT	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened."
NT	They will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God.
NT	Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
NT	and sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, "Come, for all things are now ready.'
NT	For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper."'
NT	So He spoke this parable to them, saying:
NT	And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
NT	"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
NT	and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants."'
NT	And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;
NT	"Then the steward said within himself, "What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.
NT	And he said, "A hundred measures of oil.' So he said to him, "Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
NT	Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
NT	So when He saw them, He said to them, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.
NT	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God,
NT	And He said to him, "Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well."
NT	For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.
NT	But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
NT	So Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God.
NT	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
NT	But He said, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
NT	Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.
NT	Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold."
NT	Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?'
NT	And it came to pass, when He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,
NT	saying, "Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here.
NT	and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to hear Him.
NT	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, "From heaven,' He will say, "Why then did you not believe him?'
NT	Again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
NT	So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
NT	Then they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth:
NT	Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?" They answered and said, "Caesar's."
NT	But they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.
NT	Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died.
NT	Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."'
NT	and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
NT	for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had."
NT	"These things which you see--the days will come in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down."
NT	When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.
NT	Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man."
NT	And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.
NT	So they said to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare?"
NT	Then He said to them, "With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
NT	Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves;
NT	Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.
NT	that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
NT	For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: "And He was numbered with the transgressors.' For the things concerning Me have an end."
NT	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
NT	When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
NT	And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?"
NT	Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.
NT	That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.
NT	Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.
NT	But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
NT	And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God."
NT	He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.
NT	And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.
NT	Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem.
NT	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.
NT	And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
NT	He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
NT	He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated, the Christ).
NT	Jesus said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." And they filled them up to the brim.
NT	There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
NT	Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
NT	Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?
NT	No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
NT	But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God."
NT	For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
NT	And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified--behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!"
NT	For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.
NT	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.
NT	Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John
NT	But He needed to go through Samaria.
NT	The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."
NT	You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
NT	God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."
NT	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
NT	The nobleman said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies!"
NT	For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath.
NT	Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.
NT	"I do not receive honor from men.
NT	But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.
NT	Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little."
NT	Then Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
NT	And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.
NT	And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
NT	The Jews then complained about Him, because He said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven."
NT	It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.
NT	This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.
NT	As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me.
NT	Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
NT	However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
NT	If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?
NT	On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
NT	He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water."
NT	Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why have you not brought Him?"
NT	they said to Him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.
NT	You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
NT	Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.
NT	"I know that you are Abraham's descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.
NT	But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
NT	Then the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"
NT	Then they reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are Moses' disciples.
NT	Then Jesus said to them again, "Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
NT	The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.
NT	The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.
NT	And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.
NT	do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, "You are blaspheming,' because I said, "I am the Son of God'?
NT	When Jesus heard that, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
NT	Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with Him."
NT	So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
NT	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."
NT	This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
NT	But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also,
NT	For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.
NT	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him!"
NT	This He said, signifying by what death He would die.
NT	These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.
NT	And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak."
NT	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,
NT	Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this."
NT	"I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, "He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.'
NT	Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I am He.
NT	Most assuredly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
NT	When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, "Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me."
NT	Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.
NT	Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.
NT	If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.
NT	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
NT	But these things I have told you, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them. "And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
NT	"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
NT	They said therefore, "What is this that He says, "A little while'? We do not know what He is saying."
NT	Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You.
NT	And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.
NT	And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:
NT	Then Judas, having received a detachment of troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
NT	They answered Him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am He." And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them.
NT	that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, "Of those whom You gave Me I have lost none."
NT	Jesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing.
NT	Pilate therefore said to Him, "Are You a king then?" Jesus answered, "You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."
NT	Then they said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck Him with their hands.
NT	Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid,
NT	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
NT	Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb.
NT	Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.
NT	And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace to you!"
NT	This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.
NT	Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "But Lord, what about this man?"
NT	Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?"
NT	until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen,
NT	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
NT	"For it is written in the Book of Psalms: "Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, "Let another take his office.'
NT	"Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
NT	And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?
NT	The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the LORD.
NT	"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know--
NT	Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,
NT	"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself: "The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,
NT	and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.
NT	"Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
NT	"Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life."
NT	So one came and told them, saying, "Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"
NT	For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.
NT	and said to him, "Get out of your country and from your relatives, and come to a land that I will show you.'
NT	and delivered him out of all his troubles, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
NT	"But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt
NT	But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, "Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
NT	But Solomon built Him a house.
NT	But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.
NT	Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which were done.
NT	who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
NT	For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
NT	But Peter said to him, "Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!
NT	was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet.
NT	and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
NT	And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name."
NT	And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
NT	So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
NT	At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did.
NT	And a voice came to him, "Rise, Peter; kill and eat."
NT	While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are seeking you.
NT	But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.
NT	When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.
NT	And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to answer.
NT	But they said to her, "You are beside yourself!" Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, "It is his angel."
NT	So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne and gave an oration to them.
NT	after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
NT	For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled them in condemning Him.
NT	But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
NT	Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.
NT	Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
NT	However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
NT	And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
NT	So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
NT	but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood.
NT	For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
NT	Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words.
NT	Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia.
NT	Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
NT	So they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."
NT	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, "Let those men go."
NT	But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us openly, uncondemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out."
NT	But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here too.
NT	Jason has harbored them, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king--Jesus."
NT	Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
NT	So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.
NT	Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods," because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
NT	Nor is He worshiped with men's hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.
NT	So Paul departed from among them.
NT	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
NT	for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
NT	Now the men were about twelve in all.
NT	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them.
NT	Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly.
NT	For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
NT	Now when he had gone over that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece
NT	These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.
NT	Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.
NT	What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
NT	Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
NT	Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?"
NT	"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathers' law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today.
NT	as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.
NT	"Now it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me.
NT	But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, "Be of good cheer, Paul; for as you have testified for Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome."
NT	And when it was day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
NT	Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, "Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him."
NT	But do not yield to them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you."
NT	and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring him safely to Felix the governor."
NT	Or else let those who are here themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,
NT	And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.
NT	When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about and laid many serious complaints against Paul, which they could not prove,
NT	But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?"
NT	Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.
NT	But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar."
NT	"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,
NT	And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment.
NT	When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete.
NT	So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her drive.
NT	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
NT	Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you."
NT	And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat.
NT	Now when they had escaped, they then found out that the island was called Malta.
NT	They also honored us in many ways; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary.
NT	And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
NT	For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak with you, because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
NT	which He promised before through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,
NT	and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.
NT	Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles.
NT	Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
NT	eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality;
NT	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh;
NT	Much in every way! Chiefly because to them were committed the oracles of God.
NT	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who inflicts wrath? (I speak as a man.)
NT	But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
NT	(as it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations" ) in the presence of Him whom he believed--God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;
NT	He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,
NT	And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
NT	Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
NT	Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?
NT	But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life.
NT	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.
NT	If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that it is good.
NT	For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice.
NT	I thank God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
NT	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
NT	But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.
NT	Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
NT	Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
NT	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
NT	As it is written: "For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
NT	nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
NT	it was said to her, "The older shall serve the younger."
NT	and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory,
NT	For He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, Because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth."
NT	Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved.
NT	You will say then, "Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in."
NT	Well said. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear.
NT	Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
NT	If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.
NT	Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience' sake.
NT	Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
NT	Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things.
NT	He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.
NT	For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
NT	Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.
NT	Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;
NT	It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak.
NT	And again, Isaiah says: "There shall be a root of Jesse; And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, In Him the Gentiles shall hope."
NT	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
NT	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, in word and deed, to make the Gentiles obedient--
NT	I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,
NT	Greet Mary, who labored much for us.
NT	Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, greet you.
NT	to God, alone wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
NT	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
NT	lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.
NT	For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
NT	For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, you are God's building.
NT	Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
NT	Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
NT	For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.
NT	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
NT	Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.
NT	Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.
NT	Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?
NT	Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather use it.
NT	But he who is married cares about the things of the world--how he may please his wife.
NT	So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.
NT	Do I say these things as a mere man? Or does not the law say the same also?
NT	Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of the offerings of the altar?
NT	What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.
NT	I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say.
NT	Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
NT	What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?
NT	Let no one seek his own, but each one the other's well-being.
NT	Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience' sake;
NT	for "the earth is the LORD's, and all its fullness."
NT	Give no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God,
NT	just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
NT	For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you.
NT	In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."
NT	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
NT	But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
NT	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all:
NT	If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?
NT	Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
NT	There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without significance.
NT	What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding.
NT	In the law it is written: "With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me," says the Lord.
NT	Let all things be done decently and in order.
NT	Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
NT	And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.
NT	Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?
NT	It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
NT	The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven.
NT	As was the man of dust, so also are those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly Man, so also are those who are heavenly.
NT	But I will tarry in Ephesus until Pentecost.
NT	And if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
NT	Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.
NT	that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us.
NT	I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied.
NT	All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
NT	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
NT	And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation.
NT	For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life.
NT	Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,
NT	Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,
NT	For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?
NT	I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.
NT	And we have such trust through Christ toward God.
NT	who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
NT	But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away,
NT	But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.
NT	Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
NT	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
NT	knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you.
NT	For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
NT	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you.
NT	For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you." Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
NT	by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
NT	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
NT	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
NT	Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open.
NT	Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
NT	Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:
NT	that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality.
NT	For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;
NT	For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord.
NT	Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;
NT	Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
NT	I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to minister to you.
NT	Are they ministers of Christ?--I speak as a fool--I am more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often.
NT	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
NT	But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning!
NT	Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
NT	For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults;
NT	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
NT	For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.
NT	(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)
NT	(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles),
NT	I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain."
NT	O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?
NT	What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator.
NT	Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.
NT	But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
NT	Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all.
NT	What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.
NT	My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you,
NT	but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all.
NT	Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness,
NT	For each one shall bear his own load.
NT	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.
NT	From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
NT	that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth--in Him.
NT	not of works, lest anyone should boast.
NT	For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
NT	how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already,
NT	according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
NT	to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
NT	This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind,
NT	and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.
NT	For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.
NT	Therefore He says: "Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light."
NT	that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word,
NT	Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
NT	"Honor your father and mother," which is the first commandment with promise:
NT	above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
NT	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
NT	being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;
NT	having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
NT	Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
NT	that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
NT	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state.
NT	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe.
NT	I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
NT	The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you.
NT	I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
NT	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
NT	For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell,
NT	Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
NT	As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,
NT	Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
NT	Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord.
NT	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
NT	meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains,
NT	Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
NT	For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.
NT	For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans,
NT	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.
NT	For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.
NT	For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
NT	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all.
NT	Do not despise prophecies.
NT	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
NT	that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
NT	comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.
NT	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.
NT	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,
NT	As I urged you when I went into Macedonia--remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
NT	And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
NT	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
NT	in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing,
NT	but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.
NT	For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
NT	But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
NT	And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
NT	For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain," and, "The laborer is worthy of his wages."
NT	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
NT	Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.
NT	Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
NT	who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.
NT	and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.
NT	always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
NT	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
NT	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.
NT	Be diligent to come to me quickly;
NT	Erastus stayed in Corinth, but Trophimus I have left in Miletus sick.
NT	One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
NT	that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
NT	Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded,
NT	in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,
NT	Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back,
NT	looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
NT	This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
NT	I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
NT	Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.
NT	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions."
NT	For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
NT	but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.
NT	Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
NT	For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: "So I swore in My wrath, "They shall not enter My rest,"' although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
NT	and again in this place: "They shall not enter My rest."
NT	For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.
NT	And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,
NT	For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
NT	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil,
NT	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
NT	who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.
NT	Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.
NT	Because finding fault with them, He says: "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah--
NT	Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary.
NT	which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
NT	But into the second part the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the people's sins committed in ignorance;
NT	the Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.
NT	It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience--
NT	For a testament is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives.
NT	Therefore not even the first covenant was dedicated without blood.
NT	And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
NT	Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
NT	so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.
NT	Then I said, "Behold, I have come--In the volume of the book it is written of Me--To do Your will, O God."'

NT	Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.

NT	who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously;
NT	not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing.

NT	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
NT	and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.

NT	These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots;
NT	keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
NT	To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever. Amen.
NT	His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire;
NT	And he who overcomes, and keeps My works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations--

Quran	the path of those to whom You have granted blessings, those who are neither subject to Your anger nor have gone astray.
Quran	the pious who believe in the unseen, attend to prayer, give in charity part of what We have granted them;
Quran	The lightning almost takes away their vision. When the lightning brightens their surroundings, they walk and when it is dark, they stand still. Had God wanted, He could have taken away their hearing and their vision. God has power over all things.
Quran	We said, "Strike the person slain with some part of the cow." That is how God brings the dead to life and shows you His miracles so that you might have understanding.
Quran	Woe to those who write the Book themselves and say, "This is from God," so that they may sell it for a small price! Woe unto them for what they have done and for what they have gained!

Quran	They have traded the life hereafter in exchange for their worldly life. Their punishment will not be eased nor will they receive help.
Quran	We gave the Book to Moses and made the Messengers follow in his path. To Jesus, the son of Mary, We gave the miracles and supported him by the Holy Spirit. Why do you arrogantly belie some Messengers and murder others whenever they have brought you messages that you dislike?
Quran	(Moses) brought you certain miracles. Not very long after, you began worshipping the calf which was nothing but senseless cruelty to yourselves.
Quran	But they can never have a longing for death because of what they have done. God knows the unjust well.
Quran	(Muhammad) the disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans do not like to see anything good revealed to you from your Lord. God reserves His mercy for whomever He chooses. The generosity of God is great.
Quran	When Abraham prayed to the Lord saying, "Lord, make this town a place of security and provide those in the town who believe in God and the Day of Judgement, with plenty," God replied, "I shall allow those who hide the truth to enjoy themselves for a while. Then I shall drive them into the torment of hell fire, a terrible destination!"
Quran	No one turns away from Abraham's Tradition except one who makes a fool of himself. To Abraham We have granted distinction in this world and in the life hereafter he will be among the righteous ones.
Quran	That nation is gone, they have reaped what they sowed and the same applies to you. You are not responsible for their deeds.
Quran	We certainly saw you (Muhammad) often turn your face to the sky, so We shall instruct you to face a qibla that you will like. (Muhammad) during prayer, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah). Muslims, also, wherever you are, during your prayers, turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque. The People of the Book certainly know that this command (to change the qibla) is truly from their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
Quran	Every one pursues his goal. Compete with each other in performing good deeds. Wherever you are, God will bring you all together. God has power over all things.
Quran	therefore, remember Me and I shall remember you. Thank Me and do not hide the truth about Me.
Quran	It is they who will receive blessings and mercy from God and who follow the right guidance.
Quran	Some people consider certain things equal to God and love them just as one should love God. However, the strongest of the believers' love is their love of God. Had the unjust been able to reflect about their condition, when facing the torment, they would have had no doubt that to God belongs All-power and that He is stern in His retribution.
Quran	Believers, in case of murder, the death penalty is the sanctioned retaliation: a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. However, if the convicted person receives pardon from the aggrieved party, the prescribed rules of compensation must be followed accordingly. This is a merciful alteration from your Lord. Whoever transgresses against it will face a painful punishment.
Quran	People of understanding, the law of the death penalty as retaliation grants you life so that perhaps you will have fear of God.
Quran	It is made lawful for you, during the nights of fasting, to have carnal relations with your wives. They are your garments and you are their garments. God knew that you were deceiving yourselves. He relented towards you and forgave you. Now it is lawful for you to have carnal relations with your wives and follow what God has commanded. Eat and drink until the white streak of dawn becomes distinguishable from darkness. Complete your fast, starting from dawn to dusk. It is not lawful to have carnal relations with your wives during i'tikaf in the mosque. Such are the limits of the laws of God. Do not come close to transgressing them. Thus has God explained His evidence to men so that perhaps they will have fear of God.
Quran	Complete the hajj and umrah (two parts of the rituals of pilgrimage to Makka) in obedience to God. If you are prevented from completing the duty of hajj, offer whatever sacrifice is possible and do not shave your heads before the sacrificial animal is delivered to the prescribed place. If one of you is ill or is suffering because of some ailment in your head, you must redeem the shaving of the head by fasting, or paying money, or offering a sheep as a sacrifice. When all is well with you and you want to complete the umrah in the hajj season, offer whatever sacrifice is possible. If you do not find an animal, you have to fast for three days during the days of the pilgrimage rituals and seven days at home to complete the required ten fasting days. This rule is for those who live beyond (a distance of twelve miles from) the Sacred Mosque in Mecca. Have fear of God and know that He is stern in His retribution.
Quran	It is not a sin if you try to make a profit out of the bounty of your Lord (by trading during hajj). When you leave Arafah, commemorate the name of your Lord in Mash'ar, the sacred reminder of God. Commemorate His name as He has given you guidance while prior to that you had been in error.
Quran	Commemorate (the names of) God in the prescribed days. For one who observes piety, it is not a sin to be hasty or tardy during the two days. Have fear of God and know that before Him you will all be raised after death.
Quran	As soon as they leave you, they quickly commit evil in the land, destroying the farms and people. God does not love evil.
Quran	There are those among people who give their lives to seek God's pleasure. God is Affectionate to His servants.

Quran	After a divorce for the third time, it is not lawful for the husband to resume marital relations with her or remarry her until she has been married and divorced by another husband. In that case, there is no sin for the former husband to marry her if they (both) think that they can abide by the law. These are the laws of God. He explains them for the people of knowledge.
Quran	The wives of those of you who die have to wait for a period of four months and ten days. After this appointed time, it is no sin for the relatives of the deceased to let the widows do what is reasonable. God knows well what you do.
Quran	Believers, out of what We have given you, spend for the cause of God before the coming of the day when there will be no trading, no friendship, and no intercession. Those who deny the Truth are unjust.
Quran	God is the Guardian of the believers and it is He who takes them out of darkness into light. The Devil is the guardian of those who deny the Truth and he leads them from light to darkness. These are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever.
Quran	(Or have you heard) of the one who, on passing through an empty and ruined town, said, "When will God bring it to life?" God caused him to die and brought him back to life after a hundred years and then asked him, "How long have you been here?" He replied, "One day or part of a day." The Lord said, "No, you have been here for one hundred years. Look at your food and drink. They have not yet decayed. But look at your donkey and its bones. To make your case evidence (of the Truth) for the people, see how we bring the bones together and cover them with flesh." When he learned the whole story, he said, "Now I know that God has power over all things."
Quran	The Messengers and the believers have faith in what was revealed to them from their Lord. Everyone of them believed in God, His angels, His Books, and His Messengers, saying, "We find no difference among the Messengers of God." They also have said, "We heard God's commands and obeyed them. Lord, we need Your forgiveness and to You we shall return."
Quran	They say, "Lord, do not cause our hearts to deviate from Your guidance, and grant us mercy. You are the Most Awarding One.
Quran	(Muhammad), ask them, "Shall I tell you what is far superior to worldly pleasures? Those who have fear of God will have (as their reward) gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever with their purified spouses and with the consent of God. God knows all about His servants."
Quran	The deeds of such people are made devoid of all virtue in both this life and the life to come. There will be no one to help them.
Quran	(Muhammad), consider those who have received a share of the Book. When they refer to the Book in order to judge amongst themselves, a group of them turn away with disregard
Quran	because of their belief that the fire will only touch them for a few days. This fabricated belief has deceived them in matters of their religion.
Quran	God chose (and gave distinction to) Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and Imran over all the people of the world.
Quran	He will be a Messenger of God to the Israelites to whom he will say, "I have brought you a miracle from your Lord. I can create for you something from clay in the form of a bird. When I blow into it, it will become a real bird, by the permission of God. I can heal the blind and the lepers and bring the dead back to life, by the permission of God. I can tell you about what you eat and what you store in your homes. This is a miracle for you if you want to have faith.
Quran	God is my Lord as well as yours. Worship Him for this is the right path."
Quran	Why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly hide the truth?"
Quran	God grants priority in granting mercy to whomever He wants. God's favors are great.
Quran	Why would God guide a people who disbelieves after having had faith, who have found the Messenger to be truthful, and who have received authoritative evidence? God does not guide the unjust.
Quran	(Muhammad), say, "God has spoken the Truth. Follow the upright tradition of Abraham who was not an idolater."
Quran	The People of the Book are not all the same. Some of them are straightforward. They recite the words of God in prostration at night.
Quran	(They are sent) to break the power of the unbelievers or disgrace them and make them return after having lost all hope."
Quran	The only words that they spoke were, "Lord, forgive our sins and our excess in our dealings, make us steadfast (in the fight for Your cause), and grant us victory over the unbelievers."
Quran	God is your Guardian and the best Helper.
Quran	People are of various grades in the sight of God. God is Well-Aware of all that they do.
Quran	(Muhammad), do not be grieved because of some people's haste to disbelieve. They can do no harm to God. God has decided not to give them any share in the life hereafter. There will be a great torment for them.
Quran	When God made a covenant with the People of the Book saying, "Tell the people about it (Muhammad's prophesy) without hiding any part, therefrom, they threw it behind their backs and sold it for a very small price. What a miserable bargain!
Quran	For those who have fear of their Lord, there will be gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever as a gift from their Lord. God has the best reward for the virtuous people.
Quran	There are some among the People of the Book who believe in God and what is revealed to you and to them. They are humble before God and do not trade God's revelations for a small price. They will receive their reward from their Lord. God's reckoning is swift.

Quran	Male and female are entitled to their legal share in the legacy of their parents and relatives, whether it be small or large.
Quran	If any two people commit fornication, punish them. If they repent and reform, let them go. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Quran	Worship God and consider no one equal to Him. Be kind to your parents, relatives, orphans, the destitute, your near and distant neighbors, your companions, wayfarers, and your slaves. God does not love the proud and boastful ones,
Quran	Are they jealous of the favors that God has done to some people? We have given to the family of Abraham the Book, Wisdom, and a great Kingdom.
Quran	Believers, obey God, His Messenger, and your (qualified) leaders. If you have faith in God and the Day of Judgment, refer to God and His Messenger concerning matters in which you differ. This would be a more virtuous and a better way of settling differences.
Quran	Whatever good you may receive is certainly from God and whatever you suffer is from yourselves. We have sent you, (Muhammad), as a Messenger to people. God is a Sufficient witness to your truthfulness.
Quran	The punishment for one who purposely slays a believer will be to live in hell fire forever. God is angry with him and has condemned him. He has prepared for him a great torment.

Quran	those (hypocrites) who have repented, put their trust in God, and sincerely followed only His religion will live with the believers to whom God will give a great reward.
Quran	and their statement that they murdered Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God, when, in fact, they could not have murdered him or crucified him. They, in fact, murdered someone else by mistake. Even those who disputed (the question of whether or not Jesus was murdered) did not have a shred of evidence. All that they knew about it was mere conjecture. They certainly could not have murdered Jesus.
Quran	God testifies that whatever He has revealed to you (Muhammad) He has revealed it on purpose and the angels also testify to it but God's testimony alone is Sufficient.
Quran	Believers, recall God's favors to you when a group of people were about to harm you and God made their evil plots against you fail. Have fear of God. Believers, only trust in God.

God accepted the sacrifice of one of them (Abel) but not that of the other (Cain) who then said to his brother, "I shall certainly kill you." (Abel) replied, "God only accepts the offerings of the pious ones.
Quran	Had the unbelievers had twice as much as the wealth of the whole earth in order to ransom themselves from the torment in the life hereafter, still their ransom would not have been accepted. For them there will be a painful torment.
Quran	We made Jesus, son of Mary, follow in the footsteps (of the earlier Prophets) and confirm what existed in the Torah in his time. We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, as a confirmation of the Torah and instruction and advice for the pious ones.
Quran	Because they are devoid of understanding, they ridicule your call for prayers saying that it is a useless act.
Quran	You have seen many of them establishing friendship with the unbelievers. Vile is what their souls have gained! They have invoked the wrath of God upon themselves and they will live forever in torment.
Quran	You find Jews and pagans among the worst of the enemies of the believers. (Of the non-believers) nearest to them (the believers) in affection you find those who say, "We are Christians," for among them are the priests and monks who are not proud.
Quran	Eat from the pure and lawful things that God has given to you. Have fear of God in Whom you believe.
Quran	Believers, do not ask about things which, if revealed to you, would disappoint you. If you ask about such things when the Prophet is receiving revelations, they will also be revealed to you. God has exempted you (from the responsibilities of the things you wanted to know). He is All-forgiving and Forbearing.
Quran	People living before you had asked about such things, but then rejected them.
Quran	Only God Who has created the heavens, the earth, darkness, and light deserves all praise. The disbelievers consider other things equal to Him.

Quran	They will also say, "Are these (the people of Paradise) the ones of whom you swore would receive no mercy from God?" They will continue, " People of Paradise, live therein without any fear or grief."

Quran	The righteous will receive good reward for their deeds and more. Their faces will suffer no disgrace or ignominy. They will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever.
Quran	Thus is God your true Lord. In the absence of truth there is nothing but falsehood. Then where are you turning?
Quran	They call a lie something that is beyond the limit of their knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet been revealed. Some people who lived before them also called Our revelations lies. Consider how terrible was the end of the unjust people!

On the day when it (punishment) befalls them, no one will be able to escape from it and that which they have mocked will surround them from all sides.

Quran	They will be told on the Day of Judgment, when the torment will surround them from all sides, "Suffer the consequences of your deeds."
Quran	If you ask them, "Who has sent down water from the sky to revive the dead earth?" They will say, "God has done it." Say, "It is only God who deserves all praise, but many of them do not understand."
Quran	He helps whomever He wants. He is Majestic and All-merciful.
Quran	Have they not thought that God has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them but for a genuine purpose to exist for an appointed term? Many people do not believe in their meeting with their Lord.
Quran	God begins the creation then causes it to turn back and to Him you will all return.
Quran	None of the idols will intercede for them and they will reject their idols.
Quran	To Him belongs all the thanks giving which takes place in the heavens and the earth, in the evenings and the noontime.
Quran	Turn in repentance to Him. Have fear of Him. Be steadfast in your prayer. Do not be like the pagans
Quran	You cannot make the dead listen, nor the deaf hear. Thus, they, (the disbelievers), turn away on their heels.
Quran	It is God who has created you weak, then, given you strength after your weakness and caused you to become weak and old after being strong. He creates whatever He wants. He is All-knowing and All-powerful.
Quran	These are the verses of the Book of wisdom.

Quran	Who are more unjust than those who are reminded of the revelation of their Lord, but have ignored them? We will take revenge on the criminal.
Quran	We gave the Book to Moses - do not have any doubt about the Day of Judgment - and made it a guide for the children of Israel.
Quran	They are niggardly in spending for you. When fear comes, you can see them looking at you, their eyes rolling about like to faint because of the agony of death. When their fear subsides, they start to bite you with their sharp tongues. They are miserly in spending for a virtuous cause and have no faith. God has turned their deeds devoid of all virtue. This was not at all difficult for God.
Quran	Believers, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without permission. if you are invited, you may enter, but be punctual (so that you will not be waiting while the meal is being prepared). When you have finished eating, leave his home. Do not sit around chatting among yourselves. This will annoy the Prophet but he will feel embarrassed to tell you. God does not feel embarrassed to tell you the truth. When you want to ask something from the wives of the Prophet, ask them from behind the curtain. This would be more proper for you and for them. You are not supposed to trouble the Prophet or to ever marry his wives after his death, for this would be a grave offense in the sight of God.
Quran	Those who annoy God and His Messenger will be condemned by God in this life and in the life to come. He has prepared for them a humiliating torment.
Quran	If the hypocrites, those whose hearts are sick and those who encourage the spread of evil in the city, will not desist, We shall arouse you against them and they will only be allowed to be your neighbors for a short while.
Quran	It is only God who deserves all praise. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and it is only He who deserves to be praised in the life to come. He is All-wise and All-aware.
Quran	The disbelievers have said, "There will be no Hour of Doom." Say, "By my Lord, it certainly will come. My Lord knows the unseen. Not even an atom's weight in the heavens or the earth remains hidden from Him. Nothing exists greater or smaller than this without its record in the illustrious Book.
Quran	However, those who try to challenge Our revelations will face the most painful torment.
Quran	Iblis (satan) made his judgment about them to come true. They all followed them except a believing group among them.
Quran	We are the ones who have more wealth and children and we shall suffer no punishment".
Quran	Say, "My Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants, but most people do not know."
Quran	No one will bear the burden of another. Even if an overburdened soul should ask another to bear a part of his burden, no one, not even a relative, will do so. (Muhammad), you can only warn those who have fear of their Lord without seeing Him and who are steadfast in prayer. Whoever purifies himself, does so for his own good. To God do all things return.
Quran	nor shade and heat
Quran	nor are the living and the dead. God makes to listen whomever He wants. (Muhammad), you cannot make people in the graves to listen.
Quran	Have they not travelled (sufficiently) through the land to see how terrible was the end of the mightier people who lived before them. Nothing in the heavens or the earth can challenge God. God is All-knowing and All-powerful.
Quran	so that you may warn a people who are unaware because their fathers were not warned.
Quran	It is We who bring the dead to life and records the deeds of human beings and their consequences (of continual effects). We keep everything recorded in an illustrious Book.
Quran	The Messengers said, "This ill omen lies within yourselves. Will you then take heed? In fact, you are a transgressing people."
Quran	A man came running from the farthest part of the city saying, "My people, follow the Messengers.
Quran	Follow those who do not ask you for any reward and who are rightly guided.
Quran	They will all be brought into Our presence together.
Quran	except Our mercy which could enable them to enjoy themselves for an appointed time.
Quran	Did We not command you to worship Me and tell you that this is the straight path?"
Quran	All glory belongs to the One in whose hands is the control of all things. To Him you will all return.
Quran	They say, "Shall we be brought to life again after we die and turn into dust and bones?
Quran	delicious to those who drink it
Quran	Then they will have on top of it a mixture of boiling water.
Quran	See how terrible was the end of those who were warned.
Quran	He struck them with his right hand.
Quran	and perpetuated his praise in later generations.
Quran	Thus, do We reward the righteous ones.
Quran	We helped them and they were victorious.
Quran	We stand in ranks (for prayer)
Quran	Even though they (unbelievers) say,
Quran	Peace be with the Messengers (of God).
Quran	(Muhammad), bear patiently what they say and recall Our servant, David, who had strong hands and who was most repentant.
Quran	In Our eyes he certainly has a high position and the best place to return.
Quran	(Muhammad), recall Our servant Job. When he prayed to his Lord saying, "Satan has afflicted me with hardship and torment,"
Quran	We gave him back his family and doubled their number as a blessing from Us and as a reminder to the people of understanding.
Quran	Such is their noble story. The pious ones will certainly have the best place to return.
Quran	This is what they had been promised for the Day of Judgment.
Quran	However, the rebellious ones will have the worst place to return.
Quran	Taste the scalding water, pus, and other putrid things".

Quran	He has created you from a single soul. Out of this He created your spouse. He sent you eight pairs of cattle. He creates you for a second time in the wombs of your mothers behind three curtains of darkness. He is your Lord to whom belongs the Kingdom. He is the only Lord. Where then will you turn away?
Quran	When the human being is afflicted with hardship, he starts to pray to his Lord and turns to Him in repentance. When God grants him a favor, he forgets the hardship about which he had prayed to God and starts to consider equal to God things that lead him astray from His path. (Muhammad), tell him, "You can only enjoy in your disbelief for a short time. You will certainly be a dweller of hell fire".
Quran	We have given all kinds of examples for the human being in this Quran so that perhaps he may take heed.
Quran	This Quran is a flawless reading text in the Arabic language. Perhaps they will have fear of God.
Quran	Say, "Intercession belongs to God. To Him belongs the heavens and the earth and to Him you will all return."
Quran	They were afflicted by the terrible result of whatever they gained. Besides this affliction, the unjust among them will also suffer the consequence of their deeds. They will not be able to challenge God.
Quran	(Muhammad), tell my servants who have committed injustice to themselves, "Do not despair of the mercy of God. God certainly forgives all sins. He is All-forgiving and All-merciful."
Quran	God will save the pious ones because of their virtuous deeds. No hardship will touch them nor will they be grieved.
Quran	They have not paid due respect to God. The whole earth will be gripped in His hands on the Day of Judgment and the heavens will be just like a scroll in His right hand. God is too Glorious and High to be considered equal to their idols.
Quran	Everyone in the heavens and the earth will faint in terror except for those whom God will save when the trumpet is sounded. They will all stand up and wait when the trumpet sounds for the second time.
Quran	The earth will become bright from the light of your Lord. The Book of Records will be presented and the Prophets and witness will be summoned. All will be judged with justice and no wrong will be done to anyone.
Quran	The people of Noah who lived before and the Confederate tribes who lived after them rejected Our revelations. Every nation schemed against its Messengers to seize them and disputed against them to defeat the truth. But torment struck them and how terrible was their retribution!
Quran	The bearers of the Throne glorify their Lord with His praise. They believe in Him and ask Him to forgive the believers. They say, "Our Lord, Your mercy and knowledge encompass all things. Forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path. Lord, save them from the torment of hell.
Quran	Lord, admit them and their fathers, spouses, and offspring who have reformed themselves to the gardens of Eden which You have promised them. You are Majestic and All-wise.
Quran	Worship God and be devoted to His religion even though the disbelievers dislike this.
Quran	those who dispute the revelations of God without having received clear authority. This act greatly angers God and the believers. Thus does God seal the hearts of every arrogant oppressor."
Quran	You call me to disbelieve in God and to believe other things equal to Him about which I have no knowledge. I call you to the Majestic and All-forgiving One.
Quran	God protected him against their evil plans and the people of the Pharaoh were struck by the most horrible torment.
Quran	To Moses We had given guidance and to the children of Israel We had given the Book
Quran	Those who dispute the revelations of God without having received any authority do so because of their arrogance, but their arrogance cannot bring them any success. Seek protection from God for He is All-hearing and All-aware.
Quran	It is God, your Lord, Who has created all things. He is the only Lord. Why then do you turn away from His worship to the worshipping of idols?
Quran	It is He Who created you from clay, turning it into a living germ, then into a clot of blood, and then brings you forth as a child. He then made you grow into manhood and become old. He causes some of you to live for the appointed time and some of you to die before so that perhaps you may have understanding.
Quran	Ha. Mim.
Quran	The righteously striving believers will have a never-ending reward".
Quran	The disbelievers will say, "Lord, show us the human beings and jinn who caused us to go astray. We shall put them under our feet to lower them".
Quran	a hospitable welcome from the All-forgiving and All-merciful God".
Quran	Nothing has been said to you which was not said to the Messengers who lived before you. Your Lord is certainly All-forgiving, but stern in His retribution.
Quran	Whoever acts righteously does so for his own good and whoever commits evil does so against his soul. Your Lord is not unjust to His servants.
Quran	Say, "Think, if the (Quran) is from God and you have rejected it, then who has gone farther astray than the one who has wandered far from the truth?
Quran	(Muhammad), this is how God, the Majestic and All-wise, sends revelations to you and sent them to those who lived before you.
Quran	In His hands are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants. He has the knowledge of all things.
Quran	The disputes of those who quarrel about God, after pledging obedience to Him, will be void in the eyes of their Lord. Such people will be subject to His wrath and will suffer a severe torment.
Quran	(Muhammad), if they turn away from your message, know that We have not sent you as their keeper. Your duty is only to deliver the message. When We grant mercy to the human being, he becomes joyous, but when he is afflicted by evil as a result of his own deeds, he proves to be ungrateful.
Quran	Then they said, "Why this Quran had not been revealed to a man from either of the two great towns".
Quran	We made them become of the people of the past and an example for the coming generations.
Quran	Jesus was a servant of Ours to whom We had granted favors and whom We made as an example for the Israelites.

Quran	that We have revealed the Quran on a blessed night to warn mankind.
Quran	If you do not want to believe, leave me alone".
Quran	We rescued the Israelites from the humiliating torment
Quran	He hears the revelations of God which are recited to him, then persists in his arrogance as if he had not even heard them. Tell him that he will suffer a painful torment.
Quran	To the unbelievers the Lord will say, "Were not Our revelations recited to you and did not you arrogantly reject them? You were a sinful people".
Quran	(Muhammad), ask them, "Have you thought about what you worship besides God? Show me which part of the earth they have created. Do they have a share in the creation of the heavens? Bring me a Book, revealed before this Quran, or any other proof based on knowledge to support your belief, if indeed you are truthful".
Quran	When Our enlightening revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers, of the truth which has come to them, say, "This is plain magic".
Quran	There are people who say to their parents, "Fie upon you! Are you telling us that we shall be raised from our graves? So many people have died before us and (none of them have been raised)" Their parents plead to God and say to their child, "Woe to you! Have faith; the promise of God is certainly true" They reply, "What you say is only ancient legends".
Quran	Have they not travelled through the land and seen the terrible end of those who lived before them? God brought upon them utter destruction and the disbelievers will also faced similar perdition.
Quran	God is the guardian of the believers, but the disbelievers have no guardian.
Quran	(Muhammad), how many towns, much more powerful than the one from which you have been expelled, have We destroyed and left helpless?
Quran	Know that God is the only Lord. Ask forgiveness for your sins and for the sins of the believing men and women. God knows when you move and when you rest.
Quran	God has condemned these people and made them deaf, dumb, and blind.
Quran	The disbelievers who prevent others from the way of God and give the Messengers a hard time - even after the guidance has been made clear to them - will never be able to cause any harm to God, and He will turn their deeds devoid of all virtue.
Quran	We have granted to you, (Muhammad), a manifest victory,
Quran	so that God will redeem the sins (which the pagans think you have committed against them) in the past or (you will commit) in the future. He will complete His favors to you, guide you to the right path,
Quran	Those who pledge obedience to you are, in fact, pledging obedience to God. The hands of God are above their hands. As for those who disregard their pledge, they do so only against their own souls. Those who fulfill their promise to God will receive a great reward.
Quran	The bedouins who lag behind in taking part in the battle say to you, "Ask forgiveness for us; we were busy with our property and household." They speak what is not in their hearts. (Muhammad), tell them, "Who will help you against God, if He intends to harm you, who will prevent Him from benefitting you? In fact, God is Well Aware of whatever you do".
Quran	To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives or punishes whomever He wants. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Quran	This is the tradition of God which existed before, and you will never find any change in His tradition.
Quran	It was the disbelievers who kept you from the Sacred Mosque and prevented your sacrificial offering from reaching its proper place. God would not have kept you from fighting the disbelievers, had there not been believing men and women (among them) whom you did not know and whom you might have unknowingly harmed. God did this because He grants mercy to whomever He wants. Had they been distinguishable from the believers, We would certainly have punished them with a painful torment.
Quran	God made the dream of His Messenger come true for a genuine purpose. (In this he was told), "If God wills You (believers) will enter the Sacred Mosque, in security, with your heads shaved, nails cut, and without any fear in your hearts." He knew what you did not know. Besides this victory, He will give you another immediate victory.
Quran	Had they exercised patience until you had come out, it would have been better for them. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Quran	Believers, let not a group of you mock another. Perhaps they are better than you. Let not women mock each other; perhaps one is better than the other. Let not one of you find faults in another nor let anyone of you defame another. How terrible is the defamation after having true faith. Those who do not repent are certainly unjust.
Quran	(Muhammad), say, "Do you teach God about your religion? God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He has the knowledge of all things".
Quran	In fact, it seems odd (to the pagans) that a warner from their own people has come to them. The disbelievers have said, "It is very strange

Quran	His (angelic) companion will say, "(Lord), the record of his deeds is with me and is all ready".
Quran	On the day when the earth is rent asunder, they will quickly come out of their graves. This is how easy it is for Us to bring about the Day of Resurrection.
Quran	Death to those whose opinions are merely baseless conjectures.
Quran	There is also evidence of the Truth within your own selves. Will you then not see?
Quran	The offspring of the believers will also follow them to Paradise. So shall We join their offspring to them because of their faith. We shall reduce nothing from their deeds. Everyone will be responsible for his own actions.

Quran	(Muhammad), have you ever seen the one who has turned away (from guidance),
Quran	and will be fully recompensed for his deeds.
Quran	Whenever they see a miracle, they turn away from it and say, "This is just a powerful magic".
Quran	Noah prayed, "Lord, help me; I am defeated".
Quran	We carried him, (Noah), on a vessel built with boards fixed together with nails,

Quran	filling your bellies, with it
Quran	You certainly knew about (your) first development. Why do you not take heed?
Quran	Surely, we have been deprived (of the benefits)".
Quran	It is We who have made it as a reminder and a means of comfort for the people.
Quran	why can you not bring it (the soul) back (to life)?

A barrier with a door will be placed between them. Inside it there will be mercy but outside of it there will be torment.
Quran	Is it not time for the hearts of the believers to become humbled by the remembrance of God and by the Truth which has been revealed so that they will not be like the followers of the Bible who lived before them and whose hearts have become hard like stone through the long years. Many of them are evil doers.
Quran	Know that God brings the dead earth back to life. We have explained Our revelations to you so that you may perhaps have understanding.
Quran	We sent Our Messengers with clear evidence (to support their truthfulness), and sent with them the Book and the Balance so that people would maintain justice.

God is All-powerful and Majestic.
Quran	Have you not seen those who have been forbidden to have secret counsels violate this prohibition and resume their secret counsels for sinful and hostile purposes and to disobey the Messenger? When they come to you (Muhammad), they greet you with a greeting with which even God has not greeted you and say to themselves, "Why has God not punished us for what we say (if he is a true Prophet)?"

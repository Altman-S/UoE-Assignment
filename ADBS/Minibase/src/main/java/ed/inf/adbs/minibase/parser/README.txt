The parser of our query language is built using ANTLR (https://www.antlr.org/).

Minibase.g4 defines the grammar of the query language.

The 'generated' directory contains files generated by ANTLR as follows:

    antlr4 Minibase.g4 -visitor -package ed.inf.adbs.minibase.parser.generated -o generated

Do not directly modify the generated files.

If you need to extend the grammar, modify Minibase.g4 and re-run the above command. This will regenerate new parser classes. You will probably need to modify QueryParser, too.

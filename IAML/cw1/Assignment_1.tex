\begin{question}{Linear Regression}

\questiontext{We will fit linear regression models to the data in file \texttt{regression\_part1.csv}.}
\begin{subquestion}{Describe the main properties of the data, focusing on the size, data ranges, and data types.}

\begin{subquestion}{Fit a linear model to the data so that we can predict \texttt{exam\_score} from \texttt{revision\_time}. 
Report the estimated model parameters $\mathbf{w}$. 
Describe what the parameters represent for this 1D data. 
For this part, you should use the sklearn implementation of \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html}{Linear Regression}.\\
\hint{By default in sklearn \texttt{fit\_intercept = True}. Instead, set \texttt{fit\_intercept = False} and pre-pend $1$ to each value of $x_i$ yourself to create $\boldsymbol{\phi}(x_i) = [1, x_i]$.

\begin{subquestion}{Instead of using sklearn, implement the closed-form solution for fitting a linear regression model yourself using numpy array operations.  
Report your code in the answer box.
It should only take a few lines (i.e. <5).\\ 
\hint{Only report the relevant lines for estimating $\mathbf{w}$ e.g. we do not need to see the data loading code. You can write the code in the answer box directly or paste in an image of it. }

\begin{subquestion}{Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common metric used for evaluating the performance of regression models. 
Write out the expression for MSE and list one of its limitations. \\
\hint{For notation, you can use $y$ for the ground truth quantity and $\hat{y}$ (\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}hat\{y\}\$} in latex) in place of the model prediction.}

\begin{subquestion}{Our next step will be to evaluate the performance of the fitted models using Mean Squared Error (MSE). 
Report the MSE of the data in \texttt{regression\_part1.csv} for your prediction of \texttt{exam\_score}.
You should report the MSE for the linear model fitted using sklearn and the model resulting from your closed-form solution. 
Comment on any differences in their performance.

\begin{subquestion}{Assume that the optimal value of $w_0$ is $20$, it is not but let's assume so for now. 
Create a plot where you vary $w_1$ from $-2$ to $+2$ on the horizontal axis, and report the Mean Squared Error on the vertical axis for each setting of $\mathbf{w} = [w_0, w_1]$ across the dataset. 
Describe the resulting plot. Where is its minimum? Is this value to be expected?\\ 
\hint{You can try 100 values of $w_1$ i.e. \texttt{w1 = np.linspace(-2,2, 100)}.}

## A note on working with GIT
 
 * If you are not familiar with version control systems, we recommend just downloading the repository as a zip file and using it as is. If you would like to use the repository for your own work, you **must** fork the current repository into a **private one**. Publishing your solution is **not permitted**, in line with the policy on [Academic Misconduct](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct).

## Conda Environment

For this assignment you **must** use the same versions of the packages that are specified in the [IAML Labs repository](https://github.com/uoe-iaml/iaml-labs). 
Failing to do will result in you loosing points. 

## Building the PDF

This repository provides a latex template (`Assignment_2.tex`) for generating the final PDF that you will submit. 
You **must not** edit the style or formating of this document.
The only thing you need to do is enter your student number (see PDF for instructions) and put your answers in the correct answer boxes. 

You have a few options to create the final PDF:
* From a DICE machine you can run `pdflatex Assignment_2.tex` twice from the command line to compile the PDF. 
* You can do the same from your own computer, provided you have latex and all the necessary packages installed. Unfortunately, we do not support troubleshooting this step for you. 
* You can also use a free browser based latex editor such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). **If you use such as tool, make sure to keep your document private and do not share the link to it.** 

## Submitting the Final PDF

Instructions will be provided on the IAML Learn page telling you where to upload your final PDF and code.
